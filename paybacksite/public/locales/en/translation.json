They were created by one of the largest derivatives markets globally, CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange). It wasn’t until 2008 that binary options became primarily available to the public, and many entities copied the original CBOE asset type listing.",

          "Binary options are a type of option that allows you to guess whether the option expires in the money – that’s it. Some unregulated binary options brokers allow for guessing on out of the money outcomes. A simple yes or no bet is made, hence the name binary. Contemporary binary options have expiration times between a week to a few minutes, with the majority of modern binary options platforms specializing in under one-day expirations."

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Common Scams and How To Protect Yourself</h1>" +
            "<p>The internet is a part of everyone’s daily life and has transformed our world in ways we couldn’t have previously imagined.Unfortunately, along with the conveniences and opportunities that our interconnected world offers are heightened risks.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Online scams are a perfect example of this very reality.<br/>\n" +
            "From phishing scams that aim to steal your financial information and identity to offers that are too good to be true and end up costing you money for nothing in return, the online environment has its share of scams and shady operators.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Explore some of the more common online scams you’ll want to steer clear of while learning the best practices to avoid these dangerous pitfalls altogether.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>THE ADVANCED FEE SCAM</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Have you ever received an email that claims to be from a bank, an influential foreign businessperson, or a lawyer, promising you large sums of money in exchange for a small upfront fee? If so, you’ve probably encountered the advanced fee scam – and hopefully you avoided it.</p>\n" +
            "<p>This scam always starts out by giving you the good news: you’ve been selected for a prize, inherited a large sum of money, or have been chosen to work with a successful organization.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Yet, there’s a catch: the funds are blocked and require a cash payment to unlock them. This might include processing fees or taxes to be paid on the money you’ve allegedly inherited. Moreover, the businessperson who is so keen to work with you might require an upfront fee to investigate you as a potential partner.  Here’s how the scam works:</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>The advanced fee scam is designed to make you part with your money in exchange for a large payout.</li>\n" +
            "<li>It usually uses email or text messages which are sent out to a large group of people simultaneously. Mail servers block many of these messages, and you might see some of them land in your spam folder.</li>\n" +
            "<li>Unfortunately, the payout promised by this type of scam almost never exists – and once you’ve paid the scammer, recovering your money may be next to impossible.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>To avoid these types of nefarious schemes, simply ignore emails, phone calls or text messages asking you to make a payment in exchange for a large sum of money and send it to your junk folder or report them to the infrastructure provider.<br/>\n" +
            "As with all scams, it’s important to remember the golden rule: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>GUARANTEED ACCEPTANCE FOR A CREDIT CARD OR LOAN</h2>\n" +
            "<p>If you’ve been trying unsuccessfully to obtain a credit card or personal loan, you’ll know how frustrating rejected applications can be. So, what if there was a guaranteed way to get your card or loan? That’s exactly what the guaranteed acceptance scam promises its victims.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Unlike legitimate loan or credit card applications that require a solid credit and employment history and stable personal finances, guaranteed approval scams won’t ask you for much financial information at all. That is the first sign that you’re dealing with a less-than-honest organization.</p>\n" +
            "<p>In exchange for guaranteed approval, you may be asked to pay an upfront fee, join a club, or take other actions that require you to pay the scammer immediately. As you may have guessed, once you’ve paid the fee, that’s probably the last you’ll hear from the scammer. Moreover, your credit card or loan will never materialize.</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>This type of scam often targets job seekers, students and people with bad credit.</li>\n" +
            "<li>You should be especially cautious about any offer you receive in the mail without your name on it, by email or in a text or social media message.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>To avoid the guaranteed approval scam, it’s important to remember that there’s simply no such thing as credit approval without a hard credit check and detailed financial information.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you’re dealing with a legitimate loan or credit card company, they’ll always ask you to verify your identity, income and credit record. Furthermore, it’s important to not disclose sensitive or seemingly harmless personal information over the phone to someone who reaches you directly.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>LOTTERY SCAMS</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Winning the lottery is a dream that many people wish would come true. Accordingly, it’s no wonder it’s such a popular story for scammers to tell unsuspecting victims.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you read through your junk email folder right now, chances are you’ll come across more than one lottery scam email that your email provider has already filtered for your safety. If you’re unlucky, you may receive one in your regular inbox delivering the best news you’ve had all year: you’ve just won the UK, Spanish or another foreign lottery.</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>The lottery scam works by getting you excited over your big win and baiting you with a type of upfront fee that you need to pay in order to receive or unlock the funds.</li>\n" +
            "<li>This fee could be in the form of “government taxes”, a processing or handling fee, or bank transfer fees.</li>\n" +
            "<li>After paying the fee, you’ll never hear from the scammer again and you certainly won’t receive any lottery winnings.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>Remember, every lottery in the world requires you to buy a ticket in order to stand a chance of winning. If you haven’t bought a lottery ticket, you simply can’t be the winner. It’s as simple as that.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Another type of scam you may encounter are special offers to buy guaranteed winning numbers for local or international lotteries. Any time you hear “guaranteed” and “lottery” in the same sentence, you’ll know there’s a scammer at work.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you’d like to stand the chance to win a lottery prize, simply buy lottery tickets the old-fashioned way or through your local lottery’s official website. That way, you’ll be sure you’re not getting scammed.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>PHISHING</h2>\n" +
            "<p>The phishing scam is a sophisticated type of fraud which tricks you into revealing your banking login details or personal information to the scammer through a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">fake website</a> and email address.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Typically, you’ll receive an email that looks like it was sent by your bank, online broker or PayPal.</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>The mail will scare you by telling you that your account security has been compromised and that you need to update your details immediately.</li>\n" +
            "<li>Once you click on the link in the email, you’ll be directed to a fake website that appears to look similar to the official company website the scammer is impersonating.</li>\n" +
            "<li>After you enter your details, the scammer will use them to access your real account drain every last cent.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>It’s important to note that your bank, broker or PayPal will never email you asking you to confirm your account details.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you do receive an email that looks suspicious, first make sure that it has been sent from the organization’s official email address. Then give them a call to confirm that it was really sent from a legitimate person.</p>\n" +
            "<p>To report identity theft in the US, you can visit the federal government’s <a href=\"http://www.identitytheft.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">identitytheft.org website</a>.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>OVERPAYMENT SCAM</h2>\n" +
            "<p>If you run an online store or have recently posted items for sale on a classifieds site like Craigslist, you will want to watch out for the overpayment scam.</p>\n" +
            "<p>This scam is especially easy to fall for because the scammer will actually send you money first before trying to defraud you. Here’s how it works:</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>You’ll receive a message from the scammer, to say they paid you too much for the product by mistake and asking you to refund them the difference.</li>\n" +
            "<li>They’ll typically ask you to make payment by Western Union, MoneyGram or another payment method that’s difficult to trace.</li>\n" +
            "<li>After you make the payment, you’ll realize that their original payment is fake – either the proof of payment they sent is forged or the payment will have been reversed.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>If you sell your items on eBay or Amazon remember that it’s almost impossible for someone to overpay you on these sites. The exact amount due is charged on the checkout page, so if a buyer claims to have overpaid, you should absolutely be suspicious of the supposed “buyer”.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Job seekers are always keen to find employment opportunities and scammers often take advantage of this reality.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you receive an email from someone you’ve never heard of, offering you access to a great selection of jobs with high salaries in exchange for a fee, be on your guard.</p>\n" +
            "<p>You should also be suspicious of jobs that require very few skills – like putting letters in envelopes or assembling low quality products.</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>The career opportunities scam almost always requires you to pay an upfront fee. This is typical of most scams.</li>\n" +
            "<li>It could be called a finders’ fee, job placement fee or membership fees for a job seeker’s club, or the cost of training materials or a home assembly kit.</li>\n" +
            "<li>Once you’ve paid the fee, you’ll soon realize that the jobs on offer either don’t exist or the positions have already been filled.</li>\n" +
            "<li>If the scam involves assembling products, you’ll find that nobody wants to buy them.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>Remember, when companies use employment agencies to recruit talent, the recruitment fees are almost always paid by the company – not by you. Any time you’re asked to pay upfront, you should be especially cautious.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>CHARITABLE DONATIONS</h2>\n" +
            "<p>The spirit of giving is a beautiful part of human nature, and millions of people are in need of benefit from charitable donations each year.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Unfortunately, scammers are extremely active in the online charity space. Accordingly, you’ll always want to verify before you donate.</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>If you receive an email asking for charitable donations, check the name of the charity carefully. It could be a scam.</li>\n" +
            "<li>You can check the legitimacy of a charity through give.org, the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving website. Simply enter the name of the charity to find out if it’s a scam or not.</li>\n" +
            "<li>Be especially careful of emails that feature “tearjerker” stories about poor children or families in developing countries and ask you to donate to anonymous persons.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>To ensure that your charitable donations reach people who are truly in need, it’s best to donate to well-known charities with long track records of transparently supporting successful projects.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>FREE VACATIONS</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Everyone loves a relaxing vacation and getting one for free sounds like a dream come true. Unfortunately, chances are that an offer like this could be a scam.</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>The free vacation scam always starts by giving you exciting news – you’ve won a free trip! However, to claim it, you’ll need to join a club or pay a fee.</li>\n" +
            "<li>Once you’ve paid, not only will you never receive the free trip, but you’ll also have given your credit card information to the scammer which could result in serious financial harm.</li>\n" +
            "<li>In the rare case where the scam does provide a free trip, it will usually involve extra fees, cheap flights and substandard accommodation – you could even arrive at your hotel only to find that your reservation was fake or cancelled at the last minute.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>If you’d like a chance to win a free vacation, the best strategy is to enter a competition hosted by a well-known airline, booking site or tourism business. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>MAKE MONEY AT HOME USING YOUR COMPUTER SCHEMES</h2>\n" +
            "<p>The final scam is probably the sneakiest of all. In this age of freelance work and remote jobs, there’s nothing unusual about making money at home using a computer.<br/>\n" +
            "Scammers are taking advantage of this to hide their fraudulent schemes in plain sight.</p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">\n" +
            "<li>The work from home scam usually involves something like posting reviews on unknown websites, sending out mass emails to unknown people, or other simple tasks.</li>\n" +
            "<li>You’ll be promised big earnings – usually thousands of dollars per month – for doing menial tasks. This is a big red flag.</li>\n" +
            "<li>Almost all of these scams will ask you to pay a signup fee or a training fee before you start working. Once you’ve paid this, you’ll realize that your earnings are tiny or nonexistent.</li>\n" +
            "</ul>\n" +
            "<p>To avoid being scammed like this, it’s best to always seek online work through legitimate companies or freelance sites.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>STAY SAFE, STAY LEGITIMATE, AND NEVER PAY UPFRONT</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Online scams are always evolving, but they always feature common traits; an offer that’s too good to be true, a time limit that’s going to expire soon, and an upfront payment.<br/>\n" +
            "By avoiding online offers that exhibit these characteristics and sticking to well-known websites and organizations, you’ll be able to stay safe online and enjoy the great entertainment and career opportunities that the internet and social media have to offer.</p>\n",

        header: "The Best Credit Card Fraud Detection Techniques",
        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">The Best Credit Card Fraud Detection Techniques</h1>" +
            "<p>The world is increasingly going cashless, and credit cards continue to be the leaders in payment processing due to their established infrastructure and massive networks. Indeed, with improvements in credit card technology and digital payments, credit card usage has been on the rise. The US Federal Reserve’s triennial study on payment methods in the US found that transaction volumes increased from $103.5 billion in 2015 to $111.1 billion in 2016, or 10.2%, and those numbers have continued to increase.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Even so, credit card fraud has seen parallel growth despite security improvements and stronger efforts to prevent it. A study conducted by RSA found that in the US alone, credit card transaction fraud costs merchants $508.00 per fraudulent transaction, with card-not-present (CNP) fraud showing significant growth in 2019. For merchants, this is a concerning issue, but not one that is without a solution.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Although you can never fully eliminate the risk, you can certainly mitigate it, and you can protect yourself even in the worst of cases against legal action that could be costly and damage your reputation. Here are some of the top credit card fraud detection strategies you can implement to secure your payments:</p>\n" +
            "<h2>CHECK USERS’ LOCATIONS WHEN THEY MAKE A PURCHASE</h2>\n" +
            "<p>It’s common that when users are committing credit card fraud, and especially CNP fraud, they are not usually doing so from the card’s original location. This means that a simple check that matches a user’s credit card billing address with an approximate location could reveal much about a transaction’s origin. Geolocation tools, for instance, let you track an IP address’ approximate location to match against their provided billing address.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Moreover, transactions from a single card from multiple locations in a short span may also be a red flag. Even so, it’s worth remembering that while these are good indicators, there may also be legitimate reasons for information not matching up perfectly. A cardholder who’s making a purchase from abroad may have a non-matching IP address, as would someone who holds a card from a foreign card issuer for business purposes.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>KEEP DETAILED RECORDS OF DELIVERY AND FULFILMENT</h2>\n" +
            "<p>One common strategy for fraudsters is to make purchases to wrong addresses or non-existing ones, and file <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">chargeback complaints with card processors</a>. For merchants, fighting these penalties and paying the fees can be damaging, but it’s not impossible to combat. One way to do so is to focus on keeping detailed records of every part of a transaction, even after payment has been processed.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Tracking records at each step, as well as signed proof of delivery documents, are crucial to combat any claim, as is information about order fulfilment. Make sure to maintain clear communication with your users at every step to build a clear record of your fulfilment process. Additionally, having fast delivery processes can help avoid even friendly fraud (when customers <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">request chargebacks</a> before attempting to obtain a refund from a merchant).</p>\n" +
            "<h2>EMBRACE ANALYTICS AND DATA</h2>\n" +
            "<p>One of the silver linings of CNP fraud is that it produces data. Whenever fraud occurs or fails in an attempt, you gain a wealth of knowledge about the attack and where it succeeded or went wrong. By itself, the data has limited value, but when you analyze and break it down, it can give you an excellent blueprint to help mitigate fraud in the future.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Analytics suites can help you find patterns in transactions, as well as detect suspicious activity in real time based on historic trends. More importantly, it lets you understand your defenses, and gives you areas to improve your security. You can see which indicators were missed, which you succeeded in identifying, and integrate those into your detection models for the future.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>IMPLEMENT AND MEET BEST SECURITY PRACTICES</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Surprisingly, one of the most common causes of fraud is lax standards that miss major signs of trouble. This can range from forgetting to ask basic details to missing important information such as billing address for matching, and even double-checking credit card data against users’ accounts. In many of these cases, the result is not fraud, but in those where it is, merchants may be hard-pressed to reclaim anything, or be able to prove it happened.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Following best industry practices isn’t a guarantee that you’ll completely avoid fraud, but it is a good way to mitigate your risk. Steps such as requiring users input their CVV (card verification code) can greatly reduce the opportunity for fraud. Similarly, asking for a phone number, double-checking returning users’ information, and installing multiple fraud detection tools are important steps in avoiding a pitfall for your online store.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>HAVE CLEAR PROTOCOLS FOR SUSPECTED FRAUD</h2>\n" +
            "<p>One of the big mistakes you can make when dealing with potential fraud is waiting until it becomes actual fraud. In many cases, waiting until the hammer drops means all that will be left is to pick up the pieces, not get your money back. To avoid this, it’s important to understand that you don’t have to wait to start protecting yourself against potential fraud, and that you should have clear steps in place to make sure you act early enough.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The first step should be to contact your customer directly. If you suspect the card may be fraudulent, calling to verify a purchase to the number provided may be a great way to avoid it altogether. Delaying shipments, and even alerting your payment processor are other easy steps that can save you thousands of dollars and only provide minor inconveniences to your users.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>PREVENT FRAUD</h2>\n" +
            "<p>In the end, it’s impossible to fully prevent fraud, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t work to avoid it. By focusing on detecting it and heading it off before it becomes critical, you can fight fraud and mitigate your company’s risk.</p>\n" +

            "<p>It is extremely important for investors to remain updated about the latest happenings in financial markets. Keeping track of emerging developments ultimately empowers smarter investment decision-making.</p>\n" +
            "<p>At the same time, it is vital to acquire knowledge about past instances of fraud in order to learn from them. It is worth noting that <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">stock scams</a> are among the most common frauds conducted in financial markets.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Therefore, investors must keep a tab on these scams and ensure that they do not fall prey. Keep reading to take a closer look at the most prominent stock scams in history.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>ENRON</h2>\n" +
            "<p>One of the most prominent stock scams of all time involved energy trading company Enron. This company was once counted among the top energy sector brands in the US. It became fairly popular among investors in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The company’s stock was being traded at over $90 per share.</p>\n" +
            "<p>However, during the year 2001, it was discovered that Enron was using shell companies and illegal accounting practices in order to hide large amounts of debt. This resulted in a sharp decline in the share prices, as they bottomed out to under $1. This was a major scam that led to massive wealth erosion for investors.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>WORLDCOM</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Another case that involved an accounting scandal involved telecommunication company WorldCom. The company recorded profits of $1.3 billion during the year 2001. It was one of the most well-known brands in the telecom industry. The company’s price per share stood at $60. However, during the year 2002, it was revealed that WorldCom was reporting its operating expenses in the form of investments.</p>\n" +
            "<p>This act of account manipulation led to a sharp fall in the share prices. After the scandal came under the public spotlight, WorldCom’s share price fell to $0.20. This case not only rocked the company’s investors but also resulted in massive job losses.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>QWEST COMMUNICATIONS</h2>\n" +
            "<p>During the late 1990s, Qwest Communications was among the largest telecom companies in the US. The company offered a range of services to its customers and was counted among the most recognizable brands within the telecom industry.</p>\n" +
            "<p>In 1999, the CEO of the firm stated that it was targeting double-digit revenue growth over the next few years. However, the telecom market was quickly becoming saturated, making it hard for the company to achieve its targets.</p>\n" +
            "<p>In order to cover up the situation, the company made use of fraudulent accounting and misleading financial instruments. This resulted in a huge decline in the company’s share price, leading to investor losses of around $3 billion.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>BERNARD MADOFF</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Bernard Madoff Investment Securities was a company set up by Bernie Madoff. This company executed a complex scam that allowed it to hide its hedge fund losses. The firm adopted a technique that allowed it to raise money from one set of investors to pay off others known as a Ponzi scheme (named after Charles Ponzi).</p>\n" +
            "<p>Even though the company was recording consistent gains over the years, it had only been siphoning off money from one source to pay another. This scam cost investors more than $50 billion.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n" +
            "<p>The above cases indicate that stock market investing isn’t without its risks. However, if investors pay enough attention to financial statements and don’t fall for stories that are too good to be true, they can detect the warning signs. As always, the best strategy is to diversify your portfolio in order to minimize the risks.</p>\n",

The answer is: “it depends.” In some situations, you might be surprised at how simple the process is. For a rogue charge on your credit card, for example, you can make a claim to your bank for an unauthorized transaction.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However, other cases may prove to be more drawn-out, difficult, or even impossible to resolve, for example, if you used a wire service like Moneygram, PayPoint, or Western Union. For more complicated scenarios, your best bet is to use a professional funds recovery service.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Process Of Funds Recovery</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Companies involved in funds recovery typically have staff with long experience of working in the binary options, forex, legal or banking professions. To help recover your funds, they’ll need copies of any relevant correspondence, confirmation of financial transactions, and details of the broker’s offer and website.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Some unscrupulous brokers are like bullies: they intimidate private individuals, but back down when confronted by expert professionals. Often, the simple threat of legal action is enough to shame the guilty party into action. In other cases, formal legal action may be required. The best funds recovery firms will only commence litigation where there’s a strong case, and only charge a fee in the event of a successful outcome.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Process Of Funds Recovery</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It’s a sad fact that some of the companies that promise to get your money back are in fact scammers themselves! So, how can you ensure that you choose a trustworthy company to help recover your money, instead of falling for another scam? Here are a few pointers:</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Conclusion</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">If you’ve been a victim of cybercrime when trading binary options or forex, it’s reassuring to learn that there are expert companies who can show you how to get money back. However, prevention is far better than cure, and the best way to avoid being ripped off is to take more care in the first place. Never forget the old adage that if something looks too good to be true, it generally is! But also never forget that if you’ve been scammed online by the bad guys, there are good guys out there who can show you how to get your money back.</span></p>\n",

            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Introduction</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The internet has changed the way the world works, and that applies to financial investments too. The world wide web has not only opened up new investment opportunities, but it has also created new routes to market, especially for smaller or first-time investors, or for people who traditionally use conventional stockbrokers.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Whilst those new developments are very welcome, every upside has a downside. Sadly there are many sham investment companies set up with the express intention of defrauding you should you choose to invest online. So what are the different types of online investment fraud, and what are the best ways to protect yourself from scams?</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Different Types Of Online Scams</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The different types of online scams are as varied, imaginative, and comprehensive as the internet itself. A quick Google search will reveal the scams in all their miserable glory, including:</span></p>\n" +
            "<p> </p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\"><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Schemes that promise unreal levels of return</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Crooked investment management firms that spring up, take your money, then mysteriously disappear overnight</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Dishonest brokers who take unauthorized fees or commissions from your account</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Malevolent software that purportedly offers you investment advice, but is actually used for phishing, identity theft, or advising bad trades</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Seemingly genuine trading sites that refuse to transfer any profits to you</span></li></ul>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But forewarned is forearmed, as they say. With a little care and thought, you can avoid the most common online scams.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Protecting Yourself From Fraud</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There are a number of easy steps you can take to protect yourself from the majority of online scams. Here are some common-sense suggestions:</span></p>\n" +
            "<p> </p>\n" +
            "<p> </p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\"><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>Get wise to the tactics used by scammers</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: don’t fall for irresistible offers, false promises, and misleading 100% guarantees</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>Do your homework before you start and don’t invest in markets you don’t understand</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: scammers often target new and inexperienced traders</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>Be smart</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: use resources like the ScamSmart page from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>Never download software from an untrustworthy source</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: the risks are just too great</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>Always use the safest, mainstream banking methods</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: certain financial transaction methods are safer than others</span></li></ul>\n" +
            "<p><b>Never, ever make investments after a few glasses of wine or bottles of beer</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: your normal good judgment may be impaired!</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Common Industries With A High Scam Risk</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Some industries and market sectors seem to lend themselves to ripping people off. If you want to protect yourself from online scams, a good starting point is to be aware of which sectors are renowned for being high risk. </span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">At the highest level, the mining, real estate, construction, oil/gas, and banking sectors have all proved to be highly susceptible to online fraud. And at an individual level, the E-Commerce sector continues to be a minefield at times.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Drilling down into the financial sector in specific, regrettably for any potential online investors, there are four investment areas that are especially open to fraud:</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">However, the good news is that the majority of companies operating in these sectors are genuine, and if you do fall victim to a scam, there are some excellent chargeback companies that can often help to recoup your losses.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">What To Look At When Investing Money Online</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The old mantra, “prevention is better than cure,” is the best possible advice for protection against fraud. And the next best piece of advice is to walk away if you have any doubts or worries. There are always plenty of other investment opportunities for you, especially online.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Before you even think of handing over any money and investing online, you should run through a simple checklist. Yes, this will take a little effort on your part, but if it prevents you from making a bad investment and being ripped off, it will be time well spent.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For the best scam protection when investing money online, these are the sort of considerations to bear in mind:</span></p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\"><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>Is the company fully licensed and regulated?</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> If there’s no mention of these crucial areas, walk away</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>How convincing are the online reviews?</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Planted, fake reviews often have a phony, repetitive feel to them, and don’t feature a picture of the reviewer</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>How real are the employees?</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Check out social media applications like Linked-In to see if the employee and company have a genuine presence</span></li><li style=\"font-weight:400;\"><b>How trustworthy is the company?</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Do your research, and check out the opinions of leading newspapers, financial publications, respected brokers, and informed family members and colleagues</span></li></ul>\n" +
            "<p><b>How are financial transactions handled, and how safe are they?</b><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> Remember that certain banking methods are safer, and have more back-ups and checks for protection against fraud.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Questions To Ask Before Making Final Investment Decisions Online</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Making financial investments online is quick, easy, convenient… and very exciting! But that same convenience means you need to be doubly careful in order to protect yourself from online scams. </span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Most people are rightly cautious and sensible when it comes to making real-life, face to face investment decisions. But there can be a tendency for that usual caution, reason, and common sense to go out of the window when investing online. Here are some of the questions you need to ask yourself before making a final decision:</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Online investments are no different from traditional investment methods. You wouldn’t put money into a brick and mortar company without checking it out first. So make sure you do the same with any potential online investment.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p> </p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">There’s no such thing as a 100%, sure-fire, cast-iron investment, so don’t get taken in by the hype. If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Some companies are exceptionally good at making it nigh on impossible for you to withdraw any profits. Better to check ahead of time than to be wise after the event. </span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Thoroughly read and reread every contract. It’s all too easy to be caught out by mean or underhand conditions buried in the small print. Get someone else to check the contract for you, and don’t be afraid to question the company about any doubts you may have.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Following this advice is the best way of protecting yourself from fraud. Every single investment decision comes with an element of risk, and online investments are no different. But by doing your homework, you can greatly reduce or even eliminate the chances of being ripped off.</span></p>\n",

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Pros & Cons of Automated Trading Systems – All You Need to Know</h1>" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Introduction</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">What could be simpler than an automated trading system? Just program a computer to buy or sell stocks, shares, and foreign exchange when certain criteria are met, and away you go. You can set the system up to sell when a share falls below a certain price or to buy euros when the exchange rate reaches a predetermined level. Or, you can program the computer to take into account a far more sophisticated set of circumstances and market conditions. Whichever approach you take, all you have to do is to sit back and watch your money grow. That’s how it works, right?</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">If only things were that easy! Whilst it’s definitely possible to make serious money with automated trading systems, there are also a number of potential pitfalls and challenges, especially for newcomers. So read on to learn more about the benefits and possible risks of automated trading.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Pros of Automated Trading</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Probably the biggest advantage of an automated system is that it takes the emotion out of trading. A trader may get carried away in the excitement of a deal and go too far, or conversely panic and offload stocks too quickly. Automated trading literally takes a more logical approach.</p>\n" +
            "<p> </p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Another major advantage of automated trading is the use of a concept called “backtesting”, where historical data is used to predict what will happen in the future. Because of the extensive resources needed to track vast amounts of stock market data, backtesting used to be the preserve of a few large institutions, but in recent times, it’s become more widespread.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">We human beings need to eat, rest, and sleep, and there’s a limit to how much information we can process and store. Automated trading systems, on the other hand, have no such limitations. They work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They can cover a boundless number of markets, and are able to respond immediately to any new developments, regardless of the time or day of the week.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Convenient, efficient, speedy, accessible, non-stop, cost-effective, and with comprehensive market coverage, there’s much to commend automated trading systems.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Cons of Automated Trading Systems</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Any computer system is only as good as the information and data you put into it. So if you’re using automated trading, you need to make sure your strategies are the best. In fact, this area is probably the biggest downside of trading in this way. If you don’t have automated trading strategies that work, you risk losing your money, or, just as bad, missing out on potential profits.</p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">There are other issues too. Something as simple as a power cut or a broken or slow internet connection is enough to make an automated trading system fail. Just like humans, such systems aren’t infallible: they require constant monitoring to ensure that nothing is amiss.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Automated trading systems are also complicated to design. If the underlying algorithms are incorrectly calibrated, or if certain fundamental market conditions change, there’s a chance that the system may become compromised, and actually do the opposite of what it was intended to do.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Finally, automated trading systems are rightly lauded because they take the emotion out of buying and selling, but that can be a double-edged sword. Many fortunes have been made by traders following a hunch, trusting their gut instinct, and making an inspired decision. With an automated system, such an approach isn’t possible.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Cons of Automated Trading Systems</h2>\n" +
            "<p>As with all financial transactions, you need to be aware that there are several scams associated with automated trading systems. Some scammers charge you a subscription fee for access to great trading tips which are anything but. Watch out for phony investment companies that take your money then disappear overnight, or that empty your account after one or two trades and blame it on the markets. Other seemingly genuine brokers make it difficult or virtually impossible for you to withdraw your funds.</p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">The good news is that with a little common sense, it’s easy enough to spot most of the scammers. Make sure that any company you work with is fully regulated and licensed. Don’t be taken in by 100% risk-free guarantees and the promise of huge returns. Always read the small print, and look for proof of the company’s trading record. Read the online reviews and double-check that the company has a physical presence and staff who are listed on social media sites like LinkedIn. And be very careful about what personal information you share.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Once you’ve decided that automatic trading is for you, it’s vital that you fully understand what you’re getting into. Do your research: it can be a profitable way of making money, but it’s definitely not for everyone, especially if you have a limited understanding of how stock markets and forex operate.</span></p>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Automated trading systems typically work by connecting a software platform to a direct access broker. That means that your choice of broker is especially important. Before you sign up with anyone, ask for the answers to these questions:</span></p>\n" +
            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\"> <li><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Can you provide evidence of your track record?</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#808080;\">How much do you charge, and how – flat rate, commission, sliding scale?</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#808080;\">What markets do you cover?</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Can I personalize my own settings for risks and returns?</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Is the system set up for short term or long term gains?</span></li> <li><span style=\"color:#808080;\">How easy is it for me to withdraw funds?</span></li> </ul>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">Don’t be afraid to ask questions, especially if you’re new to the game. A genuine broker will be happy to help you. And remember that if you’re unlucky enough to fall victim to a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">forex fraud</a> or <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">trading scam</a>, there are expert companies out there who may be able to help you get your money back.</span></p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Conclusion</h2>\n" +
            "<p><span style=\"color:#808080;\">There’s no doubt that automated trading should have a place in the portfolio of every serious investor. However, it’s crucial that you understand the markets in general before you jump in, and also that you continuously monitor and maintain your system.</span></p>\n",

            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Introduction</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Nowadays, thanks to the Internet, it’s extremely easy for anyone to go online and start trading in forex. Unfortunately, it’s also just as easy to fall victim to any number of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">forex frauds</a>, from phony brokers to dishonest “expert” advisors; from sham dummy companies to rogue automated trading systems.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The potential for so much online trading fraud shouldn’t necessarily put you off the forex market, but it should at the very least remind you of the need to be careful, cautious, and conscientious.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you’ve been unlucky enough to have fraudulently lost money in forex, read on for ten tips on how to ensure it doesn’t happen again. Whilst this advice is pertinent to victims of forex frauds, it’s also highly relevant to newcomers and experienced traders alike: with forex, you never stop learning!</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">1. Don’t Get Scammed Again</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Emotions can run high when you realize that you’ve been scammed, but it’s important that you remain cool, calm, and collected. First, immediately ensure that the scammers have no further access to your money: cancel any subscriptions, and block access to your bank account, for example.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Even established and trusted companies have been known to break the rules, so if there’s a grievance procedure in place, use it. Alternatively, if the company is regulated, make a formal complaint to the regulator. For companies that play hardball or that are possibly unregulated, you should consider using a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">dedicated funds recovery firm</a> (see step 2 below).</p>\n" +
            "<p>Every single person who trades in forex has made mistakes and losses along the way. But clever and successful traders analyze the reasons behind the loss, learn from their mistakes, and use that knowledge to inform their future decisions.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">2. Use An Expert To Get Your Money Back</h2>\n" +
            "<p>In cases where you’ve been treated unfairly and illegally, you may think that your money is gone forever. However, there are dedicated, professional companies that can help you recover your funds – <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback</a> being one such example. These companies employ seasoned experts from the forex, legal, and banking professions, and you can avail of their long experience to help you get your money back.</p>\n" +
            "<p>In some instances, the threat of legal action is enough to shame scammers into action, but the best fund recovery firms will also start litigation on your behalf where there’s a provable case. Regrettably, in some cases, funds are irrecoverable, but if you’ve been scammed and lost money in forex, this option is definitely worth exploring in more depth.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">3. Use An Established Broker Or System</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Forex frauds come in many forms, but the majority of scams are perpetrated by unregulated or poorly regulated firms. As they used to say as far back as Roman times, “Caveat emptor” – let the buyer beware. Remember, prevention is better than cure. Before you choose a broker or automated trading system, do your research, ask friends and colleagues for advice, check the company’s credentials for yourself, and most of all, don’t fall for excessive marketing hype.</p>\n" +
            "<p>This step may be a case of being wise after the event, but it’s important that you don’t make the same mistake twice. Choose your broker or automated trading system with care in the first place, and you can <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/how-to-avoid-forex-scams/\">avoid most, if not all, forex trading fraud</a>.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">4. Detach From Emotional Trading</h2>\n" +
            "<p>No-one likes admitting they’re wrong, but if you want to make a success of forex trading, you need to be able to detach and self-reflect on the reasons why you lost out. In some respects, forex trading is like gambling, so make sure you aren’t like that player who gambles more and more to cover their escalating losses.</p>\n" +
            "<p>In extreme cases, you may simply have to accept the reality that forex trading isn’t for you. Alternatively, you can reduce or eliminate the emotional element by working more closely with an experienced broker, or through the use of an automated trading system.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">5. Develop Your Knowledge &amp; Experience</h2>\n" +
            "<p>It may be a bitter pill to swallow, but perhaps the reason for your losses is that you lack knowledge and experience. There’s an argument that says that you can learn by doing, but if you take that approach with forex, you risk learning some very hard – and very expensive! – lessons!</p>\n" +
            "<p>So do your homework, do your research, and expand your knowledge. There are plenty of free practice accounts out there that let you hone your skills before you move on to the real thing, so take advantage of them. Better still, your greater experience will help you spot fraudsters more easily.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">6. Manage Your Risks</h2>\n" +
            "<p>The rules for risk management are deceptively simple: the higher the risk, the greater the chance of a bigger return… but the chance of major losses is also higher. That apparent simplicity shouldn’t blind you to the critical importance of a well-thought-out, risk-management strategy.</p>\n" +
            "<p>It might sound like common sense – indeed it <em>is </em>common sense! – but if you want to avoid significant losses due to online trading fraud, you should always have a robust risk/reward ratio management plan in place, long before you even start to think about trading!</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">7. Fail To Plan, Plan To Fail</h2>\n" +
            "<p>It may well be the oldest cliche in the book, but it’s true: “Fail to Plan, Plan to Fail.” A well-constructed and fully thought through trading plan is worth its weight in gold, and will help you to avoid costly mistakes. Your plan should include elements like your personal objectives, entry and exit rules, currencies and markets covered, tactics and strategies, risk management and, perhaps the most important of all, position sizing.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Forex markets are notoriously volatile, however, so remember to constantly review, monitor, and update your plan.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">8. Adapt, Adapt, Adapt</h2>\n" +
            "<p>For many traders, one of the main attractions of forex is that it’s a market in constant flux. Every day sees new economic developments, regulatory changes, political revolutions, and trade deals that impact the market. And that means that every day sees new opportunities… and new risks.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Those constant changes also mean that the ability to adapt is crucial if you want to succeed in the forex market. The most successful traders are those who can anticipate the impact of new developments, and those who can react the most speedily to change.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">9. Don’t Overtrade</h2>\n" +
            "<p>If you’re new to the game, if you’re on a roll, or if you’re chasing a loss, there can be a tendency to overtrade – in other words, to make too many transactions, or to make a transaction that’s too large. The advice here is simple and wise – don’t overtrade!</p>\n" +
            "<p>Naturally, this step ties in closely with the advice on risk management and planning. It’s all too easy to get swept up in the emotion of the moment and regret things afterward. If you have a proper plan in place, one that includes risk management, then you can avoid the dangers of overtrading: excessive losses, burnouts, poor decision-making, and depressing thoughts of what might have been.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">10. Be Realistic</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Above all, and at all times, be realistic. If you’ve had a good day, don’t be too greedy and try to milk the trade to the very last drop: do so, and you run the risk of losing the gains you’ve made. Many a trader has ended up kicking themselves for being too greedy!</p>\n" +
            "<p>That same realism applies when you’re making a loss. Don’t be tempted to chase it and risk losing even more. With forex, there’s always another day and another chance for you to be successful.</p>\n" +
            "<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Conclusion</h2>\n" +
            "<p>When it comes to forex trading, often what you <em>don’t</em> do is as important as what you do do! As an example, you should never invest more to cover a reverse without gaining a full understanding of why you made the loss in the first place. All that said, with foresight, patience, inspiration, experience and, most importantly, hard work, it’s definitely possible to make a success of forex trading.</p>\n",

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Is Binary Options Legal? The Ins And Outs Of Binary Trading</h1>" +
            "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Binary options are sometimes known as all-or-nothing options, and that phrase perfectly sums up what they’re about. Without going into too much detail, essentially you’re betting that an asset will be worth above a certain value at a certain time. If your prediction is correct, you’ll make a profit, but if you’re wrong, you’ll lose all of your investment.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Win and you’re “in the money”, lose and you’re “out of the money”, hence the ins and outs of binary options.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Binary options owe much of their popularity to their simplicity. You can make money regardless of what’s happening in the markets, you can predict your gains or losses with accuracy, plus trading is quick, easy, and doesn’t necessarily require a large investment. Described as such, they sound like the perfect investment opportunity. But is everything really as rosy as it seems? Read on to learn more, and to understand why some people have concerns about whether binary options are legit and <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options scams</a> are rife.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>Are Binary Options Legal?</h2>\n" +
            "<p>If you’re asking the question “Is binary options trading legal?”, the answer is ultimately dependent on where you live. Binary options are legit in many of the world’s leading financial markets, in countries like China, Japan, and the USA. However, they’re currently banned in a number of other major countries, such as Canada, France, Germany, and the UK.</p>\n" +
            "<p>There are many reasons why binary options aren’t legit in these countries. Primary amongst the concerns are the risks of fraud, unfair trading conditions, and unease about how certain companies in the sector operate.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If binary options trading isn’t legit where you live, you may still be able to trade by using a broker in an overseas country. But if you’re going down this road, you should be aware that you may be working with an unregulated or poorly regulated broker.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>How Are Binary Options Regulated?</h2>\n" +
            "<p>It’s interesting to note that in some jurisdictions, binary options are (or at least were) regulated not by the relevant financial services authority, but by the gambling commission. In the UK, for example, binary options were originally regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, before responsibility passed to the Financial Conduct Authority in January 2018. That fact alone is enough to sound the alarm bells for some investors, and to some extent, it reinforces the claims that binary options are a form of fixed-odds betting.</p>\n" +
            "<p>In the EU and UK, in recent times regulators have moved to largely ban binary options trading. Thus if you are looking to use a broker outside of your country, it goes without saying that you should always choose a company that’s fully licensed, ideally in a country that has a robust track record for regulation. As an example, in the USA, brokers selling binary options are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>\n" +
            "<h2>The Controversy Around Binary Options</h2>\n" +
            "<p>A quick search of the internet will reveal many articles and stories that cast doubt upon the legality and fairness of binary options. Opponents of binary options – and that includes many financial regulators – claim that the products are inherently flawed, and don’t give investors a fair chance. They say that the odds are stacked against investors, and that a roulette wheel in a casino offers a better chance of success.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Although there are undoubtedly many firms that trade within the rules, equally, it cannot be denied that there have been several high profile cases where dishonest brokers have been fined huge sums for fraud, malpractice, and ripping off clients.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>Fraudsters &amp; Binary Options</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Critics of binary options are quick to mention the proven connections between fraudsters and this form of trading. They point to a number of notorious stories in the press where brokers have been charged with and found guilty of financial irregularities.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the binary options industry, however, it’s only fair to highlight that many other companies in the financial services sector have been found guilty of sharp practices. Moreover, there are many fully regulated, reputable binary options brokers that operate legally within the rules and regulations.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Having read this far, you’re probably getting the message that yes, binary options trading is legit in some countries, and yes, you can make money with this form of trading, but you absolutely need to take the greatest care, both in your selection of a broker, and when trading.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>How To Protect Yourself, And What To Do If You Have Been Scammed</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Given that the sale of binary options is now banned in so many countries, there is a higher likelihood that any company offering such services may be fraudulent. Watch out for schemes that promise unbelievable returns, or companies that take your money, refuse to return it, and then break off all contact. Many rogue brokers have highly professional-looking websites, supposedly but fraudulently endorsed by well-known names. It’s easy to be taken in, so exercise extreme caution at all times.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you find out that you have been scammed, you have a number of options. You can make a complaint to the relevant financial regulator, although you may face issues if you are not resident in the country where the trade was made, plus regulators in some countries have comparatively limited powers.</p>\n" +
            "<p>For that reason, your best option may be to use a dedicated funds recovery service. With an expert team of legal, banking and binary options professionals on your side, you may be able to get back some or all of your funds.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n" +
            "<p>With discipline, hard work and a little luck, it is possible to make money from binary options. The convenience, speed and ease of this form of trading also make it an attractive choice. However, the fact that binary options are no longer legal in a number of important markets means that you need to tread with extreme caution: make sure any broker you work with is properly regulated, for example, and make sure you fully understand how the system works. And if you do fall foul of a fraud or scam, remember that the regulator or a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">professional funds recovery firm</a> may be able to help you.</p>\n" +
            "<p>So that’s the case for binary options. Are you in, or are you out?!</p>\n",

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Risky Investment: How to Win or Lose a Fortune</h1>" +
            "<p>It seems counter-intuitive, but negative interest rates are now a reality in several countries across the world. Institutions and high-worth individuals with money in savings accounts are actually seeing the value of their assets fall. This unprecedented situation raises important questions about high risk investment strategies. If you’re losing money by leaving it in the bank, is it time to consider other investment opportunities where you can get a better return on your assets?</p>\n" +
            "<p>Before answering that question, it’s important to state that negative interest rates aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Having a significant cash balance in the bank still provides security and certainty, but unless you specifically require short term liquidity, it may not be the best long term investment policy.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Faced with negative interest rates, many investors are now seriously re-evaluating their strategies. Do they look at risky investments with high returns, or choose safe and steady options with lower rewards? A mixture of both, perhaps? Or how about investing in venture capital, emerging foreign markets, binary options, or cryptocurrencies?</p>\n" +
            "<p>With a high-risk investment, you could make a fortune… or you could lose everything. Does that mean you should set your sights lower and settle for a smaller but safer return? Read on to learn more about your options, and how to stay safe in the choppy waters of financial investment!</p>\n" +
            "<h2>What Are Your Options?</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Before you make any decisions on your investment strategy, you should be aware of all the options. That may sound like an obvious thing to say, but many people are unaware of all the different types of financial products available. As an example, a corporate client who leaves money in a savings account for reasons of liquidity may actually find that government bonds deliver higher yields with the same levels of access.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The other important factor at play here is that financial markets never stay still. Granted, the old investment staples of stocks and bonds continue to be popular, but new markets and opportunities are springing up all the time. A few short years ago, very few people invested in cryptocurrencies, but now they’re the latest thing.</p>\n" +
            "<p>So look at all the options: from traditional staples like forex, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and index funds, to more exciting options like venture cap, emerging markets, binary options and cryptocurrencies. It all depends on what sort of investor you are: someone who likes the thrill of a high-risk investment, or someone who prefers a safer, more conservative approach.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Regardless of which type of investor you are, there’s one piece of advice that holds true across the board: only ever invest your money with a registered company. An unregulated broker might promise you the moon and stars, but the world is full of people who have lost all their money after investing with a fraudulent company. You have been warned!</p>\n" +
            "<h2>The Benefits Of Consulting With A Professional</h2>\n" +
            "<p>The benefits of choosing a registered financial professional far outweigh the risks of working with an unregulated broker. First, you can be sure that you’re working with an experienced, qualified expert: you can avail of their specialist knowledge for advice on your portfolio, taxation and investment options. Next, you have the security and peace of mind that come from working with a company that conforms to industry regulations. And finally, if anything does go wrong, you at least have some form of a comeback with the regulator.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Everywhere you look, there are hard-luck stories of people who lost everything by working with unregulated brokers and traders. Don’t fall for the hype, and don’t be taken in by the promise of unreal returns: stay safe by choosing a registered professional!</p>\n" +
            "<h2>Risk And Return: Your Choice</h2>\n" +
            "<p>For investors who like to stay safe and play the long-term game, the solutions are clear: savings accounts, government bonds, securities and the like are lower yield, but they offer high security. If you’re prepared to take a risk with your money, however, you could win big. The riskiest investments might see you lose everything… but equally, they could end up making you very rich indeed!</p>\n" +
            "<p>Here are the pros and cons of some of the more exciting forms of investment, with a high-level assessment of the risks and potential returns involved:</p>\n" +
            "<h3>Venture Capital</h3>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Chance to be in at the beginning, enjoyable to see your investment grow</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Longer-term investment, most start-ups fail</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Risk</strong>: Medium</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Potential Return</strong>s: Medium to High</p>\n" +
            "<h3>Emerging Foreign Markets</h3>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Pros</strong>: First-mover advantage, huge opportunities</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Exchange rate fluctuations, political instability</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Risk</strong>: Medium</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Potential Returns</strong>: Medium to High</p>\n" +
            "<h3>Binary Options Trading</h3>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Quick and easy trading, not dependent on what’s happening in the markets</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Rigged options, prevalence of scammers</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Risk</strong>: High</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Potential Returns</strong>: High</p>\n" +
            "<h3>Cryptocurrency Trading</h3>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Growing market, quick liquidity</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Volatility, prevalence of scammers</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Risk</strong>: High</p>\n" +
            "<p><strong>Potential Returns</strong>: High</p>\n" +
            "<h2>What To Do If You’ve Been Scammed</h2>\n" +
            "<p>With new forms of high risk, high return trading, the chances of being scammed are always greater. Investors are attracted by the chance of making a fortune, and crooks are attracted by the opportunity to scam investors who may not know enough about the market.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The first port of call if you think you’ve been ripped off is to contact your broker and ask for recompense. If that doesn’t work, then complain to your national financial regulator. Of course, if you’ve been working with an unregulated company, or with a broker overseas, you may find that you have no obvious method of redress.</p>\n" +
            "<p>People who’ve been scammed or ripped off with <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">cryptocurrency</a> or <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options</a> often believe that their money is gone for good, especially if their broker was unregulated or overseas. If that sounds like you, you should definitely explore your options with a dedicated funds recovery expert like <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack</a>. Such companies employ experienced legal and financial professionals, and their expertise can get you your money back where other approaches have failed. It’s well worth speaking to them if you’ve been scammed in any sort of financial trading: you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.</p>\n",

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Forex Trading vs Binary Options: Pros & Cons in Comparison</h1>" +
            "<p>Binary options and forex are two of the most popular forms of trading. Whilst they share many common characteristics, they also have a number of fundamental differences. Let’s start off with a brief look at the history of each, before explaining how they work, and the pros and cons of forex trading vs binary options. You can quickly jump to information on <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">Forex Scams</a> and <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">Binary Options scams</a> here.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Forex in its present-day form essentially began in 1971, when President Nixon took the decision to allow the US dollar to float freely against other currencies. As currencies fluctuated in value against one another, speculators could make a profit, essentially by buying low and selling high.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The introduction of the Euro greatly reduced the number of tradable currencies, but ultimately this had little impact on the popularity of forex. The rise of the internet and increasing globalization made forex even more widespread, and today it continues to be the largest and most liquid market in the world.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Binary options are a much more recent arrival. The market as we know it today can trace its formation back to 2008, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval for this form of trading. Other countries and regulators soon followed suit, and with binary options now available to retail traders, the market soon soared.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Binary options are also known as all-or-nothing options. If you correctly predict that an asset will be worth above a certain value at a certain time, you make a profit. But if your prediction is wrong, you lose all of your investment.</p>\n" +
            "<p>In recent times, some regulators have moved to ban binary options, amid concerns about rigged markets, fraud, and unfair trading conditions. Nonetheless, in the countries where they’re still legal, binary options remain a popular choice, so in the great forex vs binary battle, which one is for you? Read on for more information to help you decide.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>How Does Forex Work?</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Forex, or foreign exchange to give it its full name, is defined as the transfer of currency from one party to another, at a mutually acceptable price. If you’ve ever traveled abroad, you’ll have made a forex transaction to buy some local currency. But the vast majority of forex transactions aren’t made for holiday or business purposes: in most cases, profit is the motive!</p>\n" +
            "<p>When you return from your holidays with unspent foreign currency, you soon learn that when you change it back, the rates have changed. Sometimes you get a better deal, and more money back, but other times, you lose out. And that’s precisely how forex investment works, albeit on a much, much larger scale. Investors try to buy when a currency is low, in the hope that it will rise in value against other currencies.</p>\n" +
            "<p>There are several different types of forex trading, including spot markets, forward markets, future markets, options markets, and swaps markets.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>How Does Binary Trading Work?</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Binary options have become popular with investors for a number of reasons: the process is super easy, you can predict potential winnings and losses, you don’t need a huge initial investment, and you’re not dependent on what is happening in stock markets.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The principle behind binary options is simple. You make a prediction that the value of a certain asset is above a certain value at a certain time. That asset could take the form of a stock, a share, a commodity, or forex. If your prediction is right, you win. But if you’re wrong, you lose all your stake.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Here’s a simplified example of binary trade. Let’s say $1 dollar is currently worth £0.75. A binary option at $55 offers you a strike price value of £0.78, expiring on Friday at 17.00 GMT. If the final value is £0.78 or above, you win, and your option is worth $100.00. You make a $45 profit ($100 minus your original stake of $55). But if the exchange rate is less than £0.78, you lose all of your $55.</p>\n" +
            "<p>It is possible to make money with binary options, but remember that some countries have banned them over concerns of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options fraud</a> and unfair business practices.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>The Pros And Cons Of Forex Vs Binary Options: A Comparison</h2>\n" +
            "<p>There’s plenty of other trading and investment options, and you may come to the conclusion that binary options and forex are not for you. That’s perfectly fine, although it does mean you might be missing out on potential opportunities. If you do decide to trade in these markets, it goes without saying that you can greatly enhance your chances of success through practice, and by increasing your specific knowledge of the area.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The pros of forex include easy accessibility, high liquidity, fast trades, greater transparency, less market manipulation, plus reasonable fees. The cons include exchange rate volatility, lack of global regulation, and a potential in-built bias against smaller investors.</p>\n" +
            "<p>The pros of binary options include their simplicity, predictability (fixed amount of win or loss), quick payouts, plus the ability to invest small amounts. The cons include rigged markets, expensive fees, all-or-nothing results, and the prevalence of scammers.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Here’s a quick overview of some of the relative merits of binary options vs forex:</p>\n" +
            "<table style=\"width:600px;\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"200\"></td> <td width=\"200\"><strong>Forex</strong></td> <td width=\"200\"><strong>Binary Options</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Simplicity</strong></td> <td>Easy</td> <td>Easy</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Risk factor</strong></td> <td>High</td> <td>Capped</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Stability</strong></td> <td>Volatile</td> <td>Predictable</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Potential return</strong></td> <td>High</td> <td>Medium</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Scamming risk</strong></td> <td>Medium</td> <td>High</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Legal</strong></td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Limited</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Automated trading</strong></td> <td>Yes</td> <td width=\"201\">Yes</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"201\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></td> <td width=\"201\">24/5</td> <td width=\"201\">Market operating hours</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n" +
            "<h2>Your Options If You’ve Been Scammed</h2>\n" +
            "<p>The success, ubiquity and simplicity of the internet is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it greatly facilitates online trading in forex and binary options, but on the other, it hugely increases the scope for investors to be ripped off. Fake websites, rogue brokers, unregulated traders, broken promises, dishonest deals and other cons are sadly all too common.</p>\n" +
            "<p>If you’ve been ripped off, your first step should always be to complain to your broker, and if that fails, to your national regulator. However, if you’ve been using the services of an unregulated broker or an overseas company, those choices might not be open to you. In such cases, the best option is to employ a dedicated funds recovery expert: <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback</a> is a leading example. With their experienced teams of legal and financial professionals, funds recovery companies have a successful track record of helping victims of scammers to get their money back.</p>\n",

            "<p>Think cryptocurrency, and most people immediately think of Bitcoin. Amazingly, the king of cryptocurrency was first released and traded as recently as 2009. From small beginnings, experts now reckon Bitcoin has an astonishing market capitalization of over $350 billion. It’s clear that Bitcoin is here to stay.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Where Bitcoin led, other cryptocurrencies followed. Although Bitcoin continues to eclipse its rivals in terms of size, alternatives like EOS, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and ripple (XRP) have their fans, plus the forthcoming launch of Libra (supported by Facebook) promises to have a major impact on the market.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Just like physical currencies, the value of cryptocurrencies goes up and down, and you can buy and sell just as you would trade forex. Increasingly, you can use them to make purchases from vendors, plus PayPal has started to roll out support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Whilst some people have made huge profits very quickly by investing in cryptos, that same price volatility means that they are often seen as a high-risk venture.</p>\n" +
            "<p>All of which rather begs the question: is cryptocurrency legal? For the most part, the answer is yes, but read on to learn more about the legalities and intricacies of digital currencies – plus how to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/how-to-avoid-forex-scams/\">avoid some of the more prevalent scams</a>, and how these “unconventional” currencies are becoming increasingly mainstream.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>Is Cryptocurrency Legal, The Importance Of Geography And Different Types Of Currency</h2>\n" +
            "<p>A few smaller countries have outlawed certain cryptocurrencies, but in most of the major economies across the world, they remain legal.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Because of Bitcoin’s size and dominance, some jurisdictions have already moved to introduce regulations around this market leader. However, other cryptos remain untouched by regulation. The internet moves fast where governments move slow, so perhaps this patchwork approach is hardly surprising. It remains to be seen whether rules and regulations will be extended to all cryptocurrencies, but it seems highly likely that we can expect increased regulation in this area. The EU, for example, has already published draft proposals for a new law on crypto-assets.</p>\n" +
            "<p>That said, when it comes to regulating digital currencies, to a large extent the hands of governments are tied. Indeed, for many investors, the attraction of cryptocurrencies is precisely that they fall outside of the regulation, influence, and interference of national governments. Some observers even wonder whether it is legally – or indeed morally – acceptable for governments to legislate in areas that lie beyond their own borders.</p>\n" +

            "<p>In terms of market capitalization, Bitcoin is nearly nine times bigger than its nearest competitor, so it’s worth looking at this crypto Goliath in a little more detail. Naturally, Bitcoin’s dominant position has caught the eye of national governments and regulators, and some major countries – notably Canada, China, and Russia – have introduced restrictions and regulations around banking with Bitcoin. Other countries have chosen to take a lighter touch, or are still considering their options.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Bitcoin legal issues are many and complex, and they differ country by country. It should be noted that pretty much all of these legal issues apply equally to other cryptocurrencies. Depending on where you live, you may be required to pay tax on earnings, keep records of accounts, register with the authorities if you are a financial services business, and have an anti-money laundering policy in place.</p>\n" +
            "<p>So is Bitcoin legal and is it safe? Assuming you are following the rules and regulations, broadly speaking the answer is a resounding YES!</p>\n" +
            "<h2>The Biggest Legal Issues With Cryptocurrency</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Currently, the biggest legal issues around cryptocurrencies concern crimes like money-laundering, and the funding of terrorism. Opponents of digital currencies say that by allowing third-party payments from anonymous sources, cryptocurrencies may be facilitating criminal and terrorist activities.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Given the anonymity of such transactions, it is difficult to conclusively prove or disprove such accusations. However, the fact that organizations like the G7 have highlighted this issue does mean that cryptocurrencies will continue to face a degree of scrutiny in the future. There is no smoke without fire.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Against that background, however, it should also be said that it seems likely that most investors in cryptocurrencies are legal and above board: if the authorities were really concerned, surely they would have already moved to close down and ban such currencies.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>Use Case And Potential Difficulties In Handling Cryptocurrency</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Cryptocurrency exchange and make your purchase. You can also buy via websites, stores or ATMs.</p>\n" +
            "<p>Probably the biggest difficulty in handling cryptocurrency comes when you want to withdraw your money. This can frequently be a long, slow and laborious process. Unhelpful brokers, sneaky terms and conditions, and the lack of companies who accept cryptos are all additional barriers. On a more positive note, though, as cryptocurrencies evolve, many of these issues are being addressed and overcome.</p>\n" +
            "<h2>Cryptocurrency And Fraud</h2>\n" +
            "<p>Financial trading and fraud frequently go together, and sadly cryptocurrency is no exception to that rule. Normally with financial trading, it goes without saying that you should only ever use the services of a regulated broker. But with cryptocurrencies, that’s not always possible. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies exist beyond the control of governments and regulators, so that means you must tread very carefully when making any investments.</p>\n",

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Risk-Free Investments: Do They Exist?</h1>" +
            "<p>As we live through some of the most turbulent economic times in recent history, it’s totally understandable that more of us are looking for much safer places to squirrel away our savings, but are there any perfect risk-free investments out there, and how do we navigate today’s marketplace?</p>" +
            "<h2>The Benefits of Investing</h2>" +
            "<p>Whatever the state of the economy or the stock market, there will always be good opportunities to be found. Some of the benefits that you can reap include:</p>" +
            "<ul>" +
            "<li>Enjoy compound interest – The longer you’re willing to invest for and ride out any market bumps, the more you’ll benefit from compound interest</li>" +
            "<li>It can provide tax benefits – If you invest in a 401K, traditional IRA, or SEP IRA, you won’t pay tax on the year you earned it. Bonds are another great choice because any interest you earn won’t be taxed at the federal level, and many states provide tax breaks too</li>" +
            "<li>It helps you focus on a goal and build wealth – Whether you’re planning a dream family vacation, making home improvements, or building a retirement pot, investing will keep you on track</li>" +
            "</ul>" +
            "<h2>What Are the Risks of Investing?</h2>" +
            "<p>We need to caveat this section by saying you’ll never find a 100% non-risk investment. There are many financial advisors out there who might promise this, but the truth is, every type of investment will always come with some degree of risk, even if this is very small.</p>" +
            "<p>Before you make any financial decision, make sure you completely understand what might happen to your money should the worst happen. Some common pitfalls to watch out for include:</p>" +
            "<ul>" +
            "<li>Market risk – If you invest in the stock market there’s no guarantee that you’ll make money. A company riding high one day can collapse the next; make sure to diversify your portfolio</li>" +
            "<li>Inflation risk – Some less risky investments might grow very slowly, meaning they’ll be outpaced by inflation, losing you money in terms of buying power</li>" +
            "<li>Liquidity risk – If you’re invested in assets like property or penny stocks, you’ll find them difficult to convert into cash. Don’t invest in these if you need money quickly</li>" +
            "</ul>" +
            "<h2>Types of Low-Risk Investments</h2>" +
            "<p>Once you’ve weighed up the pros and cons of investing, opting for some less risky investments like the ones below is a great way to dip your toe in the water:</p>" +
            "<ul>" +
            "<li>High-yield savings accounts – A very popular form of investment offered by most banks, and the closest you’ll get to a risk-free investment. Your savings are backed up by the government under the FDIC for up to $250,000</li>" +
            "<li>Savings bonds – Bought directly from the US Department of the Treasury, these are an incredibly safe bet, though they often coming with some measly returns. You also lose interest if you cash out early</li>" +
            "<li>Dividend-paying stocks – A little riskier than the above two options, but still a fairly safe bet. Offered by larger, more successful companies, you purchase shares with the promise of regular payouts</li>" +
            "<li>Money-market funds – Probably the best choice for those wanting to invest in the stock market. This is a diversified portfolio of cash and high-credit rating securities designed to provide a short-term return. It’s rare for this type of investment to fail, but it can happen</li>" +
            "</ul>" +
            "<h2>Can You Make Low-Risk Investments and Expect a Good Return?</h2>" +
            "<p>Generally, the lower the risk of your investment, the lower your return. As detailed above, some of the least risky investments can struggle to keep up with inflation. In fact, many people take the low-risk route just as a way to consistently save money. This is best for those that aren’t looking for life-changing returns." +
            "<br>" +
            "However, that doesn’t mean to say you can’t find options out there that don’t make at least a decent profit. You may be able to find some fixed-rate savings accounts and annuities that net you a good interest rate, but you shouldn’t enter into any of the investments covered here with unreasonably high expectations</p>" +
            "<h2>Is It Possible to Reduce Risks With Fewer Options?</h2>" +
            "<p>Rather than spread yourself too thin over multiple investments, you might be able to reduce your risk by focusing on just one or two very secure options. For example, you might want to try an S&P 500 index fund, which is a mixture of stocks covering the top 500 companies in the US.\n" +
            "<br>" +
            "Since the index was founded in 1957, it’s weathered every financial storm and recession, and offered consistent growth. If you’re able to commit long term, this sort of investment is the ideal option for those looking for a retirement plan and should create above-inflation returns.</p>" +
            "<h2>What Else to Watch Out For When Investing</h2>" +
            "<ul>" +
            "<li>Fraud and scams – If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look out for shady organizations charging massive fees, pressuring you for up-front payments, promises of tax-free investments, and pyramid schemes. Make sure you thoroughly research any organization before you invest</li>" +
            "<li>Social and political factors – Recessions, pandemics, and government instability can all end up losing you money. This is just another reminder of the importance of having a diverse portfolio</li>" +
            "</ul>" +
            "<h2>How To Recover From Being Scammed</h2>" +
            "<p>Luckily, many less risky investments, like government bonds and savings accounts, are heavily regulated, and as long as you keep your wits about you, there’s a very low chance of being scammed. However, if you’ve fallen victim to fraudsters, you do have some recourse to get your money back.</p>" +
            "<ul>" +
            "<li>Credit/debit card refunds – If you paid for your investment using a credit or debit card, there’s a good chance you can recover your cash via a chargeback where your bank will request money back from the scammer’s account. Make sure you keep detailed records, documentation, and evidence of the scam to prove the malicious party failed to follow through on promises</li>" +
            "<li>PayPal refunds – If you funded your investment through PayPal, you can go through the platform’s resolution center, which has an advanced dispute mechanism</li>" +

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">A New Bitcoin Scam is in the Making on Twitter and Across Social Media</h1>" +
            "<p>Back In July 2020, Twitter was hit by a Bitcoin scam. Scammers hacked into a number of high-profile accounts and sent out a Tweet asking Bitcoin investors to lodge money to a specific cryptocurrency account. In return, twice the amount would be sent back to them, as a “charitable gesture.” Because the Tweet appeared to come from a reputable source, a number of people were duped, before Twitter blocked or temporarily closed the affected accounts.</p>" +
            "<p>The above story demonstrates two things. First, it’s proof of the skill, ingenuity, and deviousness of scammers (in this case, it’s thought they may have used Twitter insiders to help them). And second, it shows that there are still intelligent people out there who are taken in by the promise of “get-rich-quick” schemes.</p>" +
            "<p>All of which leads us to February 2021, and the latest Bitcoin scam on Twitter. Once again, this latest fraud showcased the creative ability and criminal intent of scammers. Once again, it showed just how vulnerable all social media platforms – and not just Twitter – are to cyber-attacks. And once again, it proved that users across all platforms need to stay alert and be aware of the dangers of online scams.</p>" +
            "<p>For some reason, there has been little mainstream coverage of the February 2021 scam. So read on for a thought-provoking tale involving Bitcoin scammers, Twitter, a Korean pop band, their famous global army of fans … and the unexpected resilience of the next generation.</p>" +
            "<h2>BTS, K-POP and the ARMY: How the Scam Unfolded</h2>" +
            "<p>Let’s get the acronyms out of the way first: BTS is a world-famous Korean pop (K-POP) band whose millions of enthusiastic fans are known as the ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth). Members of the ARMY tend to be young, savvy, and into the latest technical developments like cryptos – in other words, the perfect place for Bitcoin scammers to attempt to build a following, gain credibility, and then rip people off.</p>" +
            "<p>This was no ordinary scam. The perpetrators used a variety of ways and methods to advance their criminal cause. Some unscrupulous ARMY members had apparently sold their accounts to cryptocurrency companies or taken a commission in return for promoting them. Other influential members had innocently, or inadvertently, started following cryptocurrency accounts. And a number of cryptocurrency accounts had begun tagging ARMY members, offering BTS giveaways, merchandising, and albums.</p>" +
            "<p>The idea was to hype up the attraction of cryptocurrencies and engage the attention of ARMY members. Conscious of the fact that many BTS fans were young, inexperienced, and impressionable, the cryptocurrency scammers hoped to phish for personal information that would enable them to hack into private accounts.</p>" +
            "<p>It sounds like the perfect plan, but what happened next was really fascinating. Doubtless, an unspecified number of fans fell for the scam, but more significantly, many ARMY members were outraged by the idea that people were trying to rip off BTS fans. The group’s own internal cybersecurity department hit back, with warnings to members about both the scam and the dangers of sharing personal information. And after prompting from ARMY members and other sources, Twitter suspended some of the implicated accounts.</p>" +
            "<p>Interestingly, much of the ARMY’s anger was directed not so much at the potential scam, but more at the lack of transparency from members – in particular, with regard to certain BTS fans sneakily trying to make money on the back of their fellow ARMY members.</p>" +
            "<p>For the moment, things seem to have died down a little, but this story is a valuable reminder of the potential dangers of a Twitter cryptocurrency scam, and how easy it is to be ripped off.</p>" +
            "<h2>Lessons to learn from the latest scam</h2>" +
            "<p>For starters, as cryptocurrencies continue to grow in popularity, we can be sure that scammers will launch similar schemes in the future. Next, the need for vigilance is higher than ever, and not just around scammers. As this story illustrates, some influencers and high-profile accounts have zero principles and will do anything in return for a buck. However, alongside those unscrupulous influencers, there are also many good guys who make it their business to fight back against the bad guys.</p>" +
            "<p>The famous British statesman Winston Churchill once wrote “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” Those words certainly apply to the Twitter crypto scam that hit BTS and their ARMY of fans. But what other lessons can we learn from this episode?</p>" +
            "<p>Perhaps the biggest lessons to learn are the most obvious ones: the need to take care on all social media platforms, and to be extremely careful about who you follow, what links you click, and what personal information you share with others.</p>" +
            "<p>You can be sure that those who lost money, or who were taken in by the scammers, will be more careful next time. But is there any comeback for people who lost out to Bitcoin scammers? You may be surprised by the answer to that question, as there is a potential solution.</p>" +
            "<h2>You can recover scammed Bitcoin today!</h2>" +
            "<p>Cryptocurrency scammers are attracted to Bitcoin because of the lack of regulation, its anonymous nature, and the difficulty of tracing transactions.

          "<p>We’ve all heard of well-known online scams involving cryptocurrencies or the notorious Nigerian prince email. But the average losses from these two frauds are nothing when compared to dating site scams. Amazingly, on average, only fake investment schemes are more costly to victims. A report from the Federal Trade Commission shared that in 2020 over $300 million (a 50% increase from 2019) in losses from online dating scams!</p>" +
          "<p>However, it’s important to remember that not all dating sites are scams, and also that many people have found true and lasting love thanks to the internet. So to help you stay on the right side of the tracks, take advantage of our Must-Read 2021 Guide about online dating scams. We’ll tell you about the most popular scams, how to protect yourself, the added dangers of mobile dating apps, and potential comebacks if you’re unfortunate enough to get scammed.</p>" +
          "<h2>How did dating site scams originate?</h2>" +
          "<p>As long as people have been dating face to face, there have been scammers and cheats. And as long as there have been online dating sites, there have also been dating site scammers and cheats. In that respect, scammers on dating websites are nothing new.</p>" +
          "<p>The internet and mobile apps make it super easy for us to scan, filter and contact potential partners on dating sites. But the downside to all that convenience is that it also makes it super easy for scammers to scan, filter and contact potential victims.</p>" +
          "<p>You may have heard of the term “catfish” in relation to dating scams. The word is used to describe someone who uses a fake personality to trick a person into a sham relationship. In America, “Catfish: The TV Show” has become a popular program about the truth and lies surrounding online dating.</p>" +
          "<p>Sometimes with dating sites scams, there’s no financial angle. People fake relationships for their own kicks, or to teach someone they know a lesson, or simply for no-strings-attached affairs. But the fact remains that many scams are centered around money. That may take the form of a simple but bogus request for financial help, but in more sinister cases, it may result in blackmail or extortion, in return for keeping silent about the affair, or not revealing compromising messages and pictures.</p>" +
          "<h2>Some of the most well-known dating website scams</h2>" +
          "<p>A quick Google search reveals the all too real and costly dangers of online dating. A woman in Aurora, CO, lost $250,000, her house and her life savings to a conman she met on a dating site. An 80-year-old man in Florida handed over $200,000 to a scammer who’d stolen a woman’s identity. And in Ireland, the Garda (police) website tells the story of a woman who received expensive gifts from her suitor, before losing €48,000 which she invested in his sham company.</p>" +
          "<p>In every case, the people involved fell for the phony charms of an utterly convincing, smooth-talking suitor. You can be sure that the dating site scams list is far, far longer than the three examples described above, but many victims are simply too scared, ashamed, or embarrassed to come forward.</p>" +
          "<p>And there’s actually another unsavory aspect to online dating. In 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against some of the most well-known dating sites, alleging that they created false profiles in order to lure customers in. This lawsuit reminds us that if you’re paying a fee to register, you should always check the credibility of the site, read the small print, and be sure of what you’re signing up for.</p>" +
          "<h2>Tips to recognize scammers on dating sites</h2>" +
          "<p>If you’re new to the scene, you may not know how to spot online dating scams. But there are certain warning signs to watch out for. Here are some of the more common tactics used by scammers:</p>" +
          "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\"> " +
          "<li>They have an extremely attractive profile picture (which may not be their own!).</li>" +
          "<li>They hurry the relationship along and quickly suggest moving communications away from the dating website and on to texts, phone calls, or messaging apps.</li>" +
          "<li>They ask you lots of personal questions, but they consciously avoid giving you any detailed information about themselves.</li>" +
          "<li>They use words to flatter you and build you up, make you feel attractive, and give you a special pet name.</li>" +
          "<li>Once the relationship’s established, they start asking you for financial help, often for small amounts at first, before building up to larger sums. Or they may tell you a sob story about money worries, in the hope that you’ll offer to help.</li>" +
          "<li>They avoid Skype and other video calls, and never meet you in person. Any arrangements to do so are always canceled at the last moment or never come to fruition.</li>" +
          "<li>They claim to be living abroad, which is why they can’t meet up or why they need money to pay for their fare to come and see you. You may not be surprised to learn that international dating scams are actually one of the most common frauds on dating sites.</li>" +
          "</ul>" +
          "<h2>A quick warning on dating app scams</h2>" +
          "<p>Although the more established dating services like match.com started life as websites, many people now use mobile apps like Tinder, Grindr, or Bumble for dating. So what’s the difference between these apps and more traditional dating websites – and are there any additional risks that apply to apps?</p>" +
          "<p>The first point to make is that all the same warnings that apply to dating websites apply to dating apps. You still need to exercise caution and take care of what information you share.</p>" +
          "<p>That said, there are certain aspects of mobile dating apps that potentially make them riskier.</p>" +
          "<ol>" +
          "<li>First up is the issue of immediacy. We carry our mobile phones with us at all times, which means we may be tempted to respond to a message immediately, rather than taking the time to weigh up the consequences. </li>" +
          "<li>Next, mobile apps may use GPS, making the location of one or both parties clear. Such information could potentially be used for stalking, for example. </li>" +
          "<li>And finally, there’s the simple reality that the sheer popularity of apps over dating websites makes them more attractive to scammers because it gives them a greater target market.</li>" +
          "</ol>" +
          "<p>Although the more established dating services like match.com started life as websites, many people now use mobile apps like Tinder, Grindr, or Bumble for dating. So what’s the difference between these apps and more traditional dating websites – and are there any additional risks that apply to apps?</p>" +
          "<h2>How can you protect yourself from scams on dating sites?</h2>" +
          "<p>It’s very easy to be taken in when someone takes a romantic interest in us. It’s a great boost to the ego, particularly for people who’ve lost a loved one, who are lonely, or who’ve been single for a while. Just remember, however, that scammers often cynically select their victims based on people in those very situations.</p>" +
          "<p>You can help to keep yourself safe by heeding the following advice. First, only use trusted dating websites or apps: take time to research the best scam-free dating sites. Check to see if the person has a presence on other social media platforms, and be wary if they don’t, or if they have a fake-looking profile. Use Google’s image search feature to see if the person’s picture is being used elsewhere. And be extremely careful about sharing any personal information, especially any financial details or intimate pictures.</p>" +
          "<p>In that first flush of interest, it can be difficult to trust your instincts, especially because the other person could really be genuine. But always remember at the back of your mind that they might be stringing you along.</p>" +
          "<p>Many people who’ve lost money to a dating app or dating site scam simply write off their losses, because they believe it’s impossible to get their money back, or because they’re too embarrassed by what happened. At Payback, however, we take a different view. We’re great believers in justice and fairness, and we don’t think scammers on dating websites should be able to get away with their criminal actions.</p>" +
          "<p>To that end, we offer a discrete, confidential, and highly effective funds recovery service for people who’ve been ripped off by scammers on dating sites. Why not give us a call right now to discuss how we might be able to help you? You may be able to recover money that you thought was gone forever.</p>",

      text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Instagram Bitcoin Scams: The Dangerous Truth in 2021</h1>" +
          "<p>Instagram and Bitcoin have some stuff in common. Both are relative newcomers to the digital space, and both have experienced unprecedented growth in recent times. Instagram started life in 2010 as a simple mobile app for sharing photos and videos, but it’s grown to become much more than that. It’s now one of the most popular social media platforms, with over a billion people using Instagram every month</p>" +
          "<p>Meanwhile, since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has grown from nothing to become the world’s most important digital currency. As of early 2021, it’s estimated to have a market capitalization of over $600 billion.</p>" +
          "<p>The phenomenal rise of these two digital platforms has attracted huge numbers of subscribers and investors – and regrettably, huge numbers of scammers too. So here’s the dangerous truth in 2021 about Instagram Bitcoin scams.</p>" +
          "<h2>How did dating site scams originate?</h2>" +
          "<p>Users of Instagram tend to be young, tech-savvy, and fashionable, with over 60% of the demographic falling between the ages of 18 and 34. Fans of Instagram love it because it’s so up-to-the-minute, full of cool celebrities and on-trend influencers, plus it’s easy to shop there.</p>" +
          "<p>But the same things that make Instagram so appealing to subscribers also make it attractive to scammers. In the fast-moving world of Instagram, it’s all too easy to be taken in by bogus get-rich-quick schemes, fake profiles or celebrity endorsements, fantastic giveaways that are anything but, and fake luxury goods at unbelievable prices. Often the scammers take advantage of the young age and relative inexperience of Instagrammers. Moreover, the platform’s popularity also gives crooks the opportunity to reach a wide audience with ease.</p>" +
          "<p>Many scams on Instagram involve the best-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The secretive, unregulated nature of Bitcoin lends itself to fraud: once the transaction is done, it’s notoriously difficult – or even impossible – to track where your money has gone. And because cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new area, many people have little experience of how they work, making them even more susceptible to scammers.</p>" +
          "<p>The frauds are as creative and varied as Instagram itself. Bitcoin scams on Instagram come in all shapes and sizes, from fraudulent bitcoin mining schemes to phishing, from counterfeit or non-existent goods to Ponzi pyramid schemes, from blackmail to wallet thefts. And as Bitcoin grows in popularity, so do the scams. Reports state that cryptocurrency-related crimes added up to a staggering $2.6 billion in 2020, albeit that figure is down on 2019’s record number.</p>" +
          "<p>So what can you do to make sure you don’t fall for an Instagram Bitcoin scam? The younger generation might not care to admit it, but all the old cliches apply. Prevention is better than cure. Let the buyer beware. And the old favorite: if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p>" +
          "<p>Above and beyond the trusted, old-fashioned advice, there are also a number of simple steps you can take to stay safe. Often, there are common warning signs, plus if you’re aware of what form the scams take, it can help you to avoid them. And even if you do get scammed, there may still be a way to get your Bitcoins back. Read on to learn more.</p>" +
          "<h2>How can you tell a Bitcoin scammer on Instagram?</h2>" +
          "<p>If it was easy to spot a Bitcoin scammer on Instagram, then no-one would ever get ripped off. The sad fact is that many scammers are brilliant at what they do, devising sophisticated and highly convincing frauds. That said, once you know what to look for, it becomes easier to differentiate between genuine and rogue operators.</p>" +
          "<p>Online scammers use a range of techniques and tactics to try and ensnare their victims. Many of these methods apply to all social media platforms, not just Instagram. So here’s some advice on how to identify Bitcoin scam Instagram fraudsters, and what you can do to avoid being taken in:</p>" +
          "<uL class=\"ab__rs-list\">" +
          "<li><b>Don’t fall for the hype:</b> Often scammers will make inflated promises or offer unreal returns. Be especially wary of contacts who pressurize you with short-term offers saying that you’ll miss out unless you sign up there and then. In cases like this, you’ll often see a rogue login link – so don’t be tempted!</li>" +
          "<li><b>Look beyond the flashy images:</b> An Instagram post, a company profile, or a website may look sleek and sophisticated, but that doesn’t mean that it’s genuine. Watch out for cloned profiles and scam websites that look like the real thing.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Take a step back:</b> ask yourself why a celebrity would back a Bitcoin scheme. There’s a long history of fake celebrity endorsements on all social media channels, including Instagram. </li>" +
          "<li><b>Watch out for bad grammar or poor spelling:</b> Genuine companies will take the time to get this right, whereas scammers often fail to look after the small details. Often once you spot one minor mistake, other warning signs will become readily apparent.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Take care what you share:</b> Be on your guard with any companies who ask you for personal or private information upfront. Never share any of your financial details unless you are 100% certain that the company is genuine.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Be cynical:</b> if a stranger starts following you, ask yourself why.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Trust your intuition:</b> If something doesn’t feel right, it generally isn’t. Don’t be wise after the event: the world is full of people who let their heads rule over their hearts!</li>" +
          "</uL>" +
          "<h2>Common Bitcoin scams on Instagram:</h2>" +
          "<p>Bitcoin Instagram scams take many forms. Here are some of the more common types:</p>" +
          "<uL class=\"ab__rs-list\">" +
          "<li><b>Phishing:</b> there are plenty of Instagram scammers out there trying to collect (or phish for) your personal information, such as codes, passwords, or login details. Common tactics include impersonating the Bitcoin brand, or offering supposedly useful services once you’ve entered your details. Remember, never, ever share your private Bitcoin key.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Fake exchanges:</b> watch out for fake exchanges that buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Some actually appear to trade legitimately for a while before vanishing. It’s an obvious thing to say but only work with trusted, genuine exchanges.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Mining scams:</b> Bitcoin mining scams on Instagram are a popular form of fraud. People are taken in by the chance to come together and use their collective power to “mine” for and be rewarded, with new Bitcoins. In reality, many of the companies offering this service are simply a front to take your money from you.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Flipping:</b> with flipping, companies promise to flip your investment right back to you with amazing returns. So they’ll exchange your Bitcoins at a great rate once you’ve paid a joining fee, or they’ll return them almost instantly with amazing interest. Except, of course, they simply disappear once you’ve sent them your money.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Pyramid schemes:</b> Remember Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme, with fantastic returns until the pyramid comes crashing down? Well, Instagram has been home to many similar frauds. You have been warned!</li>" +
          "<li><b>Digital wallet thefts:</b> a digital wallet is where you hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Many wallet operators are genuine, but some aren’t – so be careful where you keep your Bitcoins and don’t share your private key.</li>" +
          "</uL>" +
          "<h2>What happens if you fall victim to an Instagram Bitcoin scam?</h2>" +
          "<p>One of the advantages of using payment forms like PayPal or a credit card is that you may have some form of a comeback if you’re ripped off. But that’s not the case with cryptocurrencies: if you’ve fallen victim to an Instagram Bitcoin scam, that’s it – your money’s gone forever.</p>" +
          "<p>Or is it? It might surprise you to learn that in certain cases, you may actually be able to get your money back. Regulators across the world have woken up to what’s happening in the crypto space, and are starting to get their act together. But perhaps more significantly, a number of dedicated funds recovery companies – such as Payback – have developed the relevant skills and tools to go after scammers and get back monies that have been taken fraudulently.</p>" +

      text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">The Nigerian Prince Scam is still fooling people in 2021! Protect Yourself</h1>" +
          "<p>To a large extent, the Nigerian prince scam has become a victim of its own success. It’s now seen as a joke and is widely recognized for what it is – an outdated con that was used by fraudsters in the early days of email and the internet. Surely nobody these days would fall for such an obvious scam, would they?</p>" +
          "<p>It might surprise you to learn that as recently as 2018, the Nigerian prince scam was estimated to have raked in over $700,000 – and that figure was just from unsuspecting Americans. Even today, there are people who still believe the story of the generous prince who promises to share his untold millions with you, if only you’ll send him a small advance, or your bank account details.</p>" +
          "<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the Nigerian prince email scam is still as relevant as it ever was. In its original form, it still has enough appeal to take in unsuspecting victims. But more importantly, it serves as a reminder that the scammers haven’t gone away – they’ve merely refined their methods, changed their tactics, and moved on to additional platforms.</p>" +
          "<p>So read on for a brief history of Nigerian prince scams, the most common tactics, and advice on how you can protect yourself from this and similar internet frauds.</p>" +
          "<h2>How did the Nigerian prince scam start?</h2>" +
          "<p>Would you believe that the Nigerian prince scam dates back hundreds of years? At the time of the French Revolution (the end of the 18th century), handwritten letters were sent out, begging for money to help release a nobleman languishing in a Spanish jail. In return, the grateful nobleman would repay you lavishly for your help in securing his freedom. But, of course, there was no nobleman, and any funds forwarded simply disappeared.</p>" +
          "<p>The so-called “Spanish Prisoner” con was an early example of an advance-fee scam, where a huge sum was promised in return for a relatively small upfront investment. Then, as now, the story appealed to our human nature – risky, yes, but with just enough credibility that it could be true, mixed in with the romantic ideal of helping a noble person who’d fallen on hard times, and above all, the chance of untold riches!</p>" +
          "<p>So the basic scam has been with us for many years, although the Nigerian prince has long since replaced the Spanish Prisoner. But some things never change. Once the fall-guy has sent the money, the scammer either disappears or says that they’ll need just a little more cash in order to release the funds… which, naturally, never happens.</p>" +
          "<p>Moving swiftly forward to the 1980s, people began to receive international scamming letters through the post. Such letters were often sent using counterfeit stamps. Then in the 1990s, we saw the rise of email and the internet, which suddenly made communication a whole lot easier and cheaper. And that’s when the Nigerian prince email scam really started to take off.</p>" +
          "<p>In response to the growing number of advance-fee and money laundering schemes originating there, the Nigerian government established the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in 2003. The creation of this law enforcement agency underlined the fact that many of these crimes were centered in Nigeria. However, it’s important to remember that many similar style scams originate from other countries.</p>" +
          "<h2>How to recognize a Nigerian prince scammer?</h2>" +
          "<p>If you have an email address, then at some stage in your life you’ve probably received a Nigerian prince email. In many respects, email is the perfect format for a Nigerian prince scammer. It’s relatively cheap, easy, and convenient to send out a spam email, and scammers only need a few respondents to make everything worthwhile.</p>" +
          "<p>But the Prince of Nigeria scam isn’t just about email. Other electronic forms of communication like SMS and fax machines are also just as convenient for crooks. And that’s before we even mention popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. All of these platforms make it relatively simple for one person to contact huge numbers of potential victims.</p>" +
          "<p>By now, most of us are wise to the tactics used by Nigerian prince scammers and can see them coming a mile off. Here’s a list of some of the more obvious red flags:</p>" +
          "<ul class=\"main__marker-list\">" +
          "<li>The original email, tweet, SMS, or contact is unsolicited </li>" +
          "<li>The sender has a royal title or claims to be a foreign dignitary. More recently, this has evolved to include Middle Eastern bankers, US soldiers fighting overseas, lottery winners, rich orphans, and sons of Russian Oligarchs </li>" +
          "<li>The scam is usually linked to a country or region where there’s corruption, confusion – and plenty of money! </li>" +
          "<li>The sender says they’ll share a huge amount of money with you, but only after you’ve sent them funds or your bank details</li>" +
          "</ul>" +
          "<h2>Key characteristics of the Nigerian prince email</h2>" +
          "<p>Although we might laugh at the idea of the Nigerian prince scams, in essence, they’re no different from all the other forms of internet fraud, from a “double your Bitcoin” swindle to a fake, money-grabbing online date. In every case, the aim of the scammers is the same: to cheat you out of your hard-earned cash.</p>" +
          "<p>Because the Nigerian prince email scam has been around for so long, it’s a relatively simple matter to identify the key characteristics and form of the content. If you receive an email containing any of the features below, the alarm bells in your head should start ringing immediately!</p>" +
          "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">" +
          "<li><b>An emotional appeal to your better nature:</b> this may take the form of a seemingly small request for help, and is often designed to tug at your heartstrings. The language used may be personal and emotionally-charged</li>" +
          "<li><b>A small initial request:</b> the scammer may ask an apparently innocent and innocuous question in order to establish contact with you. Only later on will the true motive appear</li>" +
          "<li><b>Poor English and grammatical errors:</b> this may appear obvious after the event, but ask yourself this question: if someone was a prominent member of a royal family or a top international banker, wouldn’t they be able to spell correctly?</li>" +
          "<li><b>The promise of unreal returns:</b> whilst some of the content may be designed to engage with your higher nature, there’s also an appeal to your baser instincts – namely, the chance to make big money for a small investment</li>" +
          "<li><b>A request for personal information:</b> you can only help the person – and secure your returns – if you share private information, like your bank details</li>" +
          "<li><b>Increasing demands:</b> once you’ve been hooked, you may find yourself facing additional requests for more and more funds</li>" +
          "<li><b>The trail suddenly goes cold:</b> this is typically accompanied by unusual activity in your bank account, alongside the sickening realization that you’ve been conned</li>" +
          "</ul>" +
          "<h2>How to protect yourself from Nigerian prince scams?</h2>" +
          "<p>With a little common sense, it’s not too difficult to reduce the risk of being scammed. Don’t trust emails or communications from people you don’t know. If you’re tempted to reply, before you do, seek a second opinion from someone you respect.</p>" +
          "<p>Learn the obvious warning signs that come with internet scams. Never, ever give your bank details to strangers. Look for the truth behind the hype. Make sure your computer security is up to date (this will often prevent fraudulent spam from getting anywhere near your inbox). And above all, remember that if something looks too good to be true, it usually is.</p>" +
          "<p>Many people who’ve been victims of internet scams let things lie, either because they believe that their money must be gone forever, or because they’re too ashamed to admit that they fell for such an obvious hoax.</p>" +
          "<p>This is where Payback comes in. We’re one of the first companies to wise up to what was happening on the darker side of the web, and we’ve made it our business to recover funds for people who’ve been affected by any sort of cybercrime, including Nigerian prince scams.</p>" +

          "<h2>The History of Nigerian Facebook Scams</h2>" +
          "<p>The Nigerian Facebook scams we see today have their origins back in the early days of the internet during the 1990s, when scammers would send thousands of spam emails asking for cash. We’re all familiar with the old Nigerian Prince scheme, in which fraudsters would email victims pretending to be a rich Nigerian, promising vast sums of cash for anyone that handed over their financial details." +
          "<br>" +
          "Operations have become a little more sophisticated since then, and have evolved into a range of Nigerian Facebook scams. These crimes are known as 419 frauds, named after the Nigerian penal code section that deals with such offenses. It’s estimated that more than 50% of these types of scams the world over now originate in the country.</p>" +
          "<h2>How do Nigerian Scammers on Facebook Operate?</h2>" +
          "<p>The scammers still utilize some of the spam tactics of the old days, often sending out thousands of messages per day in order to ensnare their victims. Those most often targeted these days tend to be vulnerable groups such as lonely hearts looking for romance and people that have lost loved ones, or appealing to people’s greed by promising free money." +
          "<br>" +
          "Nigerian scammers on Facebook will even stoop to impersonating trusted friends and loved ones from your contact list in an effort to increase the chances of success. Fraudsters will try to work their way into your trust, commenting on posts, building a relationship, and attempting to connect with mutual friends to add legitimacy." +
          "<br>" +
          "Nigerian citizens are well connected, and its growing telecoms industry now has more than 100 million people online. Coupled with fluency in English, it’s incredibly easy for a group of criminals to set up a Facebook scamming operation. As soon as the government cracks down on one, two more pop up to take its place.</p>" +
          "<h2>Common Nigerian Scams on Facebook</h2>" +
          "<h3>Nigerian Military Scams</h3>" +
          "<p>Nigerian military scams are one of the most common types of fraud on Facebook. Here, perpetrators will steal photographs of genuine members of the US military, using them to set up a fake profile. They’ll then trawl groups and profiles looking for anyone with a connection to the armed forces, or those looking for love, before sending a message or commenting on posts." +
          "<br>" +
          "After building up a level of trust with the victim, the fraudster will then start to make requests for money to be sent via wire transfer. These will usually start small so as not to arouse suspicion, and will be for items like new pieces of equipment or a credit card for off-base expenses." +
          "<br>" +
          "The scam slowly builds until larger and larger sums are requested, purported to be for medical bills or travel costs, but of course, it’s all a sham. Typical targets will be lonely women in their late 30s to late 70s.</p>" +
          "<h3>Nigerian Romance Scams</h3>" +
          "<p>Romance scams often go hand in hand with the aforementioned military scam but cover a much broader target market. Scammers will leave comments, or message Facebook users out of the blue, honing in on those with single relationship status. The scam has elements of a honey trap, as beautiful women will pretend to be attracted to young men, claiming they want a relationship." +
          "<br>" +
          "Many use fake or stolen pictures and will send hundreds of friend requests per day in the hopes that users are drawn in by a pretty face. Then, once accepted, the fraudsters will use the same sort of begging tactics of other scams, claiming they need funds transferred for various expenses, always dangling the chance of a meeting to keep victims interested.</p>" +
          "<h3>Inheritance Scams</h3>" +
          "<p>An evolved form of the old email scam, the classic inheritance scam is still with us, and people are still falling victim to it. In this Nigerian Facebook scam, elderly and lonely victims are often the intended targets and will be sent messages claiming to be holding on to an inheritance. All the victim needs to do is send a ‘verification payment’ and the full funds will be released." +
          "<br>" +
          "Scammers are getting a little more sophisticated these days and are setting up fake profiles of family members of the intended victim in order to extract funds. Elderly Facebook users might be less likely to be suspicious if they see a message from a supposed family member claiming they have an inheritance due, and may not do any digging.</p>" +
          "<h3>The Friend In Need Scam</h3>" +
          "<p>This is one of the newer Nigerian scams on FB and involves the perpetrator setting up a dummy account from a victim’s friends list. This includes copying pictures and posts to make them look legitimate. The scammer then emails their ‘friend’ claiming they’ve got in some financial hot water and need bailing out." +
          "<br>" +
          "The fraudsters work to script and often look for people on vacation, with a common claim being they were robbed in a foreign country and need their friend to bail them out. The best way to deal with this type of scam is to make your account completely private.</p>" +
          "<h3>Blackmail Scams</h3>" +
          "<p>In a step up from the romance scam, malicious parties are now drawing victims into compromising situations via Facebook. While users think they might have found a new long distance love interest via Facebook, they’ll instead be tricked into adult video messaging chats that will be recorded by the scammer." +
          "<br>" +
          "The victim will then be threatened with exposure to their friends and family unless they pay up. This particularly vicious scam has seen a sharp rise in recent years and is definitely one to watch out for.</p>" +
          "<h2>How Can You Protect Yourself From Facebook Scams from Nigeria?</h2>" +
          "<uL class=\"main__marker-list\">" +
          "<li>Never send money to those you haven’t met in person – While this seems like obvious advice, you’d be surprised at just how manipulative scammers can be and how often people will do this</li" +
          "<li>Change your privacy settings – Make sure your Facebook account is completely private, and is set up to block anyone outside of your friend group from commenting or messaging</li>" +
          "<li>Watch out for spelling and grammar issues – These are usually a sure sign something is wrong, and you should be especially suspicious of poor spelling on accounts that claim to be from people you know</li>" +
          "<li>Someone wants to take the conversation off Facebook – This is another major red flag. Never contact someone outside of the platform unless you’re 100% sure of their identity</li>" +
          "<li>Never accept friend requests from people you don’t know – This is probably the most sensible advice to stay safe. If the scammers can’t contact you, they can’t con you</li>" +
          "</uL>" +
          "<p>However, no matter how many measures you take to protect yourself, there’s always a chance you’ll fall victim to a Nigerian Facebook scam. It’s certainly possible to get your money back and, at PayBack, our experts have years of experience in hunting down perpetrators and recovering funds that have been lost to fraud.

            "<h2>What Is a Military Romance Scam?</h2>" +
            "<p>With the rise of dating websites, apps and social media platforms, those looking for true love have more options than ever before to find their perfect partner. However, the online world can be plagued with scammers, waiting to take advantage of vulnerable lonely hearts and con as much money as possible from their targets." +
            "<br>" +
            "The military romance scam remains one of the most common types of online frauds, with the US Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) claiming they receive hundreds of calls each day from people reporting fake profiles, and from victims that have been swindled out of their cash." +
            "<br>" +
            "The scammers will pretend to be members of the US military online, slowly gaining the target’s trust over time, before using various methods to extract funds from them. Many victims can find themselves thousands of dollars out of pocket, and in extreme cases, up to $450,000 was lost by one innocent party alone.</p>" +
            "<h3>How do Military Romance Scams Work</h3>" +
            "<p>Fraudsters will search social media profiles and official US military websites for images of genuine soldiers. They’ll then download and steal these photographs and use them to set up fake profiles across dating sites, social media platforms and messaging apps." +
            "<br>" +
            "They’ll then start searching for vulnerable victims, often targeting widows and older women, or those who might be more susceptible to their advances. You might be surprised to learn that most army romance scams are carried out on Facebook, where perpetrators will test the waters by targeting groups." +
            "<br>" +
            "The vast majority of those targeted are women aged from the late 30s to late 70s that are living in the US, although the scammers have been known to hook victims from across the globe." +
            "<br>" +
            "Once drawn in, the fraudsters play on the target’s loneliness, slowly building up a relationship over time before starting to request transfers of funds. The scammers aren’t just limited to military love scams either, in a particular insidious twist, they’ll also target grieving widows or parents that have lost relatives on active service. They hope to prey on a victim’s genuine desire to help out a member of the armed forces that might need assistance.</p>" +
            "<h2>Where do Military Romance Scammers Come From?</h2>" +
            "<p>The majority of military romance scams originate from West Africa, particularly Nigeria. The perpetrators tend to be young men that have been attracted to criminal life because the rewards are far higher than taking an honest job. This type of fraud is rife in the country, with an estimated 50% of all global email frauds emanating from here." +
            "<br>" +
            "While the Nigerian government is attempting to crack down on these operations, they can be difficult to track, and many scammers face no consequences if they get found out by their victims." +
            "<br>" +
            "Nigeria is one of the best-connected countries in West Africa and has a huge telecoms industry, with more than 100 million citizens now online. This prevalence of internet access, coupled with fluency in English, means these scams are incredibly easy to set up and are often operated by large criminal groups, sending hundreds, if not thousands of messages each day.</p>" +
            "<h2>What Are the Most Common Platforms for Military Romance Scams</h2>" +
            "<h3>Military Scams on Dating Sites</h3>" +
            "<p>While not as common as Facebook scams, dating sites remain a popular target for fraudsters. Generally, the fake profile will claim to be either stationed overseas or to be living in another part of the country, making it difficult to meet up in person. They’ll tend to profess their love for the victim fairly early on into the relationship, and phrases like ‘My love’ or ‘My darling’ tend to be early red flags that something is amiss." +
            "<br>" +
            "Dating site scams tend to be a longer con than on social media, as the perpetrator will slowly build up the relationship, teasing an eventual meeting several months down the line. This gives them plenty of time to start with small requests for cash, for example, they may claim that they need money for new boots or equipment, and this eventually builds up to larger requests such as cash for an emergency situation." +
            "<br>" +
            "One common request is money for airline tickets, when the scammer claims they’d like to visit the victim in person, but will say they don’t have the money for it. If the scammer is claiming to be stationed overseas, this could mean they’re potentially asking for thousands of dollars for a plane ticket, but of course, they’ll never show up.</p>" +
            "<h3>Social Media</h3>" +
            "<p>Military romance scams are far more prevalent on social media, particularly on Facebook. They work slightly differently to dating website frauds, and usually start with fairly innocuous comments on your posts. The perpetrators will usually target military groups and pages in order to narrow down their list of victims. Comments and likes will be a way of testing the water to see how receptive you are to the advances of a stranger." +
            "<br>" +
            "The scammers will usually work from scripts, and have responses for a variety of situations that might come up, including lists of hobbies and interests, with each one designed to push you into the next stage before finally asking for money transfers. They’ll often try to take the conversation away from Facebook and onto messaging apps to do this.</p>" +

            "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">" +
            "<li>Very few comments or followers – If the social media account you’re interacting with doesn’t have a lot of activity, then it’s a good sign it’s a fake. If you’re suspicious, ask them to send an email from their official US military account, each genuine one should end with ‘.mil’ </li>" +
            "<li>Don’t trust requests for cash – The military will cover all medical and equipment costs for active service members, and those on leave will still be paid a salary. Any request for cash should be a major red flag and not to be trusted</li>" +
            "<li>Fast escalation of the relationship – If someone moves the relationship on quickly, professes their love early or is generally pushy, this is often a sign of a scam</li>" +
            "<li>Duplicate profiles – scammers will often steal the real name of a soldier as well as their photos. A quick search of social media will reveal if there are any duplicate profiles</li>" +
            "<li>Ask questions – If you’re suspicious, ask lots of detailed questions, and use Google reverse image search to verify photos. Simple interrogation of the scammer is usually enough to put them off</li>" +

      text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">17 Cryptocurrency Investment Scams You Must Know About</h1>" +
          "<p>The seemingly unstoppable bull run of 2021 has seen Bitcoin regularly reach staggering new highs while taking a whole clutch of other cryptocurrencies along for the ride. The price peaks have been spurred on by increasing institutional investment and the adoption by big-name investors like Elon Musk.</p>" +
          "<p>This has brought a flood of brand new retail investors into the crypto sphere, and with it, an explosion in the number of scammers, ready to take advantage of naive new investors. Luckily, we’re here to help and have covered the top 17 crypto scams both new and old investors need to be aware of.</p>" +
          "<h2>Social Media Scams</h2>" +
          "<p>Social media is plagued with crypto scammers. One of the most common tricks is for untrustworthy parties to spam tweets and Instagram posts with various crypto hashtags, or pretend to be popular exchanges. The posts will promise free signup bonuses or advice, but will actually contain a malware link. We’d never recommend clicking any suspicious links or engaging with social media accounts unless you can 100% verify the identity of the poster.</p>" +
          "<h2>Social Engineering Scams</h2>" +
          "<p>More sophisticated than spam or phishing attacks, a social engineering scam will use psychological tricks to part you from your cash. Hackers will attempt to steal passwords to your cryptocurrency exchange account or pretend to be your online wallet provider in order to get you to hand over information.</p>" +
          "<p>In a more blunt form of this scam, the perpetrator will claim to have compromising images of you taken from your webcam and will threaten to release them unless you hand over your precious Bitcoin. Don’t fall for this, and never click on links from unknown addresses.</p>" +
          "<h2>DeFi Rug Pulls</h2>" +
          "<p>DeFi is short for ‘Decentralized Finance’ and is an umbrella term for a number of cryptocurrency financial applications. The rug pull scam operates when an organization will lock in your crypto funds over an agreed time period in a smart contract, with promises of a large payout at the end.</p>" +
          "<p>While many of these schemes are set up by legitimate actors, they tend to be riddled with vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. When the contract ends, you can find your account has been emptied. If you want to invest in a DeFi smart contract, make sure it’s undergone a full security and vulnerability audit and has a trusted track record.</p>" +
          "<h2>Fake Bitcoin Exchanges</h2>" +
          "<p>In most countries, you’re required to buy your Bitcoin from a regulated exchange. Fake organizations might try to lure you in with the promise of zero fees, or the chance to buy crypto at cheaper than market rates. However, once you’ve handed over your cash, you’ll find the exchange has disappeared only a few months later.</p>" +
          "<p>Always check that your chosen exchange is fully registered and regulated, and check out online reviews to confirm its validity before you sign up.</p>" +
          "<h2>Fake Cryptocurrencies</h2>" +
          "<p>Just about anyone with basic coding skills can create a brand new cryptocurrency from scratch. Scammers will often launch a new coin with promises that it’s going to be the next big thing, or guarantee that you’ll double your investment within a month. Some even offer the chance to win prizes if you buy a certain amount. Fraudsters will target users via email campaigns and social media posts, and once they’ve ‘sold’ enough of their coins, you’ll never hear from them again.</p>" +
          "<p>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Always do your due diligence before investing and verify the names behind the project.</p>" +
          "<h2>Malware</h2>" +
          "<p>A fairly simple, but all too common Bitcoin scam. Malware is one of the oldest types of cyberattacks and it’s adapted to exploit vulnerabilities in the crypto space. Hackers will attempt to gain access to your online wallet, scan your device for your crypto addresses and even replace the destination address for payments with their own.</p>" +
          "<p>Make sure your device antivirus is fully up to date, never touch suspicious attachments and only download programs from legitimate platforms.</p>" +
          "<h2>Imposter Websites</h2>" +
          "<p>This is actually quite a sophisticated level of scam where imposters will mimic legitimate websites like exchanges and crypto wallet providers. Designed to look identical to the real thing, users are tricked into entering personal data and financial details.</p>" +
          "<p>Red flags to watch out for include: pressure to deposit funds quickly, unsolicited emails with links to the fake site and excessive communication or spam. Always check the URL too in order to ensure it’s legitimate.</p>" +
          "<h2>Fake Mobile Apps</h2>" +
          "<p>Similar to imposter sites, fake mobile apps will impersonate real exchanges in the iOS and Google Play stores. Once downloaded, these will farm your data and take payments to a fake account. Thankfully, Apple and Google are pretty good at filtering out the fakes, but if you use another app store, you might find yourself more at risk.</p>" +
          "<p>Many of the fraudulent versions will have slightly different names to their legitimate counterparts, and again, you may find yourself pressured to make purchases if you download one.</p>" +
          "<h2>Bad Tweets and Other Social Media Updates</h2>" +
          "<p>The majority of cryptocurrency scams on Twitter and other social media platforms come from fake accounts. Some might pretend to be famous influencers, while others might be pretending to be a development firm promising big returns. Most will offer links to click or websites to visit where you can invest in certain projects. We’ll stress again, don’t click on social media links, and don’t trust deals that are too good to be true.</p>" +
          "<h2>Scamming Emails</h2>" +
          "<p>Email scams might just be the oldest type of cyber attack there is. They’re usually relatively easy to spot and can include blackmail tactics, get rich quick schemes or simple messages to get you to click a ransomware link. Most email platforms these days are pretty effective at blocking out this type of mail, but if any do sneak through, we’d recommend reporting it as spam and deleting it. Never trust any message from unsolicited sources or unknown parties.</p>" +
          "<h2>Phishing</h2>" +
          "<p>While the most popular type of phishing attacks are still via the mass email campaigns we’ve mentioned above, there are other types of attacks to watch out for too. Spear phishing for example will attempt to build up a detailed user profile, gathering info on you such as name, address, bank details and date of birth. It’s quite rare to see individuals targeted, but you can protect yourself by using two-factor authentication and complex passwords for all of your online accounts.</p>" +
          "<h2>Fraudulent ICOs</h2>" +
          "<p>ICO stands for ‘Initial Coin Offering’ and will be used when new crypto developers are looking to raise funds to create a new coin, develop an app or launch a new service. It’s estimated that a staggering 80% of ICOs are fake, making it incredibly difficult to find genuine ones. Scammers will usually tout their offering as the ‘Next Bitcoin’ with seemingly unbelievable returns. You’ll instead be forking over money for nothing.</p>" +
          "<p>If you’re new to the world of crypto, we’d recommend keeping your distance from ICOs. Experienced investors should do full due diligence on any project before handing over cash.</p>" +
          "<h2>Bitcoin Blackmail Scams</h2>" +
          "<p>We’re seeing an increasing number of blackmail scams popping up as fraudsters see opportunities to capitalize on people’s fears. Scammers will claim to have juicy personal information on you such as details of an affair you’re having, evidence of your logins to your PayPal account or claims to have video footage of you from your webcam. The message then demands you send money to a Bitcoin address or your secrets will be revealed to your full list of contacts.</p>" +
          "<p>In the vast majority of cases, these will be scammers simply taking a chance, sending thousands of emails and hoping one sticks. These can be safely ignored.</p>" +
          "<h2>Impersonation Giveaway Scams</h2>" +
          "<p>The most common impersonation scam will be someone setting up a fake social media account of somebody famous, which will then tweet or post with offers of an investment opportunity. Others will promise bounty rewards or airdrops of Bitcoin for the first sign-ups. However, each link only leads to a fraudster’s account.</p>" +
          "<p>Platforms themselves can also be subject to attack, as seen back in July 2020 when a number of high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised. Hackers used the official accounts of Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Apple among others to scam users out of more than $100,000 worth of Bitcoin. Never click on any links, and don’t trust anything that’s too good to be true.</p>" +
          "<h2>Ponzi or Pyramid Schemes</h2>" +
          "<p>Ponzi schemes are related to the fraudulent ICOs we mentioned earlier, but work a little differently in that early investors will actually see some initial payouts. Investors will be asked to stump up large sums of cash to purchase a brand new coin and will be rewarded with money brought in by new investors a few weeks or months later.</p>" +
          "<p>The initial participants (having seen some good returns) will now be convinced the project is a success and will encourage others to join, as well as putting more of their own money into the scheme. Eventually, the scammers shut it down and make off with the profits. These are pretty easy to spot and you should avoid any new offering that pressures you to recruit fresh investors.</p>" +
          "<h2>Mining Scams</h2>" +
          "<p>Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are ‘mined’ via the solving of complex mathematical equations. Individual users can contribute to this process by signing up for a cloud mining service, lending the computing power of their device to the mining operation. Once equipment and electricity costs are taken into account, though, your profits will generally be quite small these days and it’s just not worth it for most.</p>" +
          "<p>However, scammers have now stepped in to take advantage of naive investors that don’t know the pitfalls of crypto mining, promising huge returns. These are often just fronts to steal data or will come with multiple hidden fees. If you’re new to crypto, we’d recommend staying away from any sort of mining activity altogether.</p>" +
          "<p>Pumps and Dumps</p>" +
          "<h2>As we’re still in the early days of crypto development and investment, many coins share characteristics with speculative investments, leaving them open to market manipulation. A pump and dump scheme involves a group of coordinated buyers purchasing a particular coin in large quantities, usually smaller altcoins with very small market caps in order to hike the price up.</h2>" +
          "<p>The scammers will then promote the coin across social media, driving many newbies to invest in the hopes of getting rich quickly. Once the price has been sufficiently inflated, the organizers will dump their entire holding and cash out. This then crashes the price for those that invested late, leaving them with worthless coins.</p>" +
          "<p>Keep your eye out for low-market-cap coins that experience a sudden jump in price, and be very wary of social media accounts promoting such products.</p>" +
          "<h2>How Can You Get Your Money Back After a Cryptocurrency Scam?</h2>" +
          "<p>If you’ve lost money to a crypto scam, don’t lose hope. While it might feel like the industry is a little like the Wild West, there are multiple ways to recover your investment. Here at PayBack, our team of legal experts specializes in cryptocurrency scam recovery and you’ll be assigned a caseworker to investigate every possible avenue for getting your money back.</p>" +
          "<p>A popular method of recovery is to use chargeback, in which banks and card providers can reverse any payments made via your credit or debit card. Payback will conduct a detailed investigation into your case, identifying the scammers, alerting the relevant authorities and using every legal channel available to get you refunded.</p>",

      text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">The $155 Million Pump and Dump Stock Scam in Hong Kong</h1>" +
          "<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has left many of us trapped indoors with nowhere to spend our disposable income. Stuck at home, people have been turning to the stock market in droves as a way to make some extra cash, hedge against inflation and even as a way to simply pass the time." +
          "<br>" +
          "However, millions of new amateur investors are at risk of more stock scams than they might realize, and the recent ramp and dump debacle in Hong Kong serves as a timely reminder for newbies and veterans alike.</p>" +
          "<h2>What Happened in Hong Kong?</h2>" +
          "<p>In early March, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the local police raided a number of upmarket homes in the city, arresting 12 people accused of operating a pump and dump scheme." +
          "<br>" +
          "The perpetrators had been touting stocks on social media in order to draw in thousands of fresh investors, artificially raising the price of the targeted shares, which is known as the ‘pump’. The scammers then ‘dumped’ the stocks, extracting profit for themselves, which crashed prices for those investors still left holding the bag.</p>" +
          "<h2>How do Pump and Dump Scams Work?</h2>" +
          "<p>With more of us investing in securities, we’re seeing an increase in these types of scams. The fraudsters will often pose as legitimate companies, industry experts and even impersonate famous online influencers in order to spread their scam message. They favor social media platforms and anonymous messaging sites like Telegram and Discord to promote a chosen stock." +
          "<br>" +
          "The perpetrators will then pump up a chosen stock, claiming it as the next big thing, telling users they can double or triple their investments if they buy now. They’ll coordinate hype, misinformation and rumors to get as many investors to purchase that particular stock as possible, artificially inflating the price." +
          "<br>" +
          "Brand new investors are particularly susceptible to this type of scam, and once enough unsuspecting marks have poured their money into the stock, the scammers will dump their entire holdings, making off with the profits.</p>" +
          "<h2>What Type of Stocks are Targeted?</h2>" +
          "<p>Fraudsters will usually target low-value stocks, or those with small market caps, as these are much more straightforward to manipulate. Plus, it’s easier to get someone to believe that a cheap share is going to skyrocket soon, especially once they start seeing gains. These stocks generally only take a small number of investors to boost the price, meaning the perpetrators can easily coordinate buyers on social media.</p>" +
          "<h3>How Can You Spot Pump and Dump Scams?</h3>" +
          "<uL class=\"ab__rs-list\">" +
          "<li>Being solicited directly – If you get an email or a DM on social media out of the blue from an unknown party telling you that a stock is about to explode, it’s almost certainly a pump and dump scheme. Ignore it</li>" +
          "<li>An unexplained rise in price in the last few days – If you start to see suspicious posts on social media and message boards, go and check the price history for that stock. If there’s been a spike in the last few days, but no prior history of growth, you’ve almost certainly landed on a ramp and dump. Look for news articles that might explain the price rise. Has the company seen new investment? Higher sales? If all you can find is social media posts, then avoid like the plague</li>" +
          "<li>Big promises of guaranteed returns – Any sensible investor will tell you there’s no such thing as a 100% guaranteed return. Anyone promising big returns is usually a red flag across all stock scams, not just pump and dumps. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is</li>" +
          "<li>Stocks are pushed by unregistered brokers – Sometimes the scammers will pose as an official brokerage in order to add legitimacy, but this is all part of the scheme. Always check that your chosen broker is registered with the SEC or local financial authority before you hand over a penny</li>" +
          "</uL>" +
          "<h2>How Can You Recover Your Money From a Stock Scam?</h2>" +
          "<p>If you suspect you’ve been the victim of a pump and dump scheme, it can sometimes be difficult to get your money back, especially if you don’t know where to start the search.

      header: "A Guide to Chargebacks: Recover Your Funds After a Scam",
      text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">A Guide to Chargebacks: Recover Your Funds After a Scam</h1>" +
          "<h2>Chargebacks: Getting Back Your Money After Being Scammed</h2>" +
          "<p>With the increase of online trading, as well as the reliance on the internet, we’re perhaps more prone to scams now than ever before. The tactics used are increasingly more sophisticated, and the ways you can be scammed are multiplying. It’s also worth noting that people of all competencies are using the web, so even some of the oldest ways of parting people with their cash are still just as effective.</p>" +
          "<p>In instances of credit card fraud, we trust that our banks will be able to recover our money or at the very least, recredit our accounts. But what if you fall foul of a crypto scam? Or, what happens if you end up losing money through Nigerian advance-fee fraud? Read on to learn what a chargeback is and how they work.</p>" +
          "<h3>What Is A Chargeback?</h3>" +
          "<p>Chargebacks involve returning fees spent through a transaction, whether on a credit card, debit card, or through PayPal. In many ways, it’s the same as claiming a refund on missold or defunct items and asking for your money back.</p>" +
          "<p>However, not every chargeback requires some kind of transaction to have taken place, nor does it mean the amount spent is even done by you. In many cases, the amount that’s been debited from your account is a matter of fraud, or you’ve given it away yourself, only to find that the promise you were sold on is a scam, like a Ponzi scheme, or a bad broker that’s misusing your investments.</p>" +
          "<h3>How Do Chargebacks Work?</h3>" +
          "<p>How chargebacks work is entirely different for the consumer chasing their funds and the company that’s doing the chasing. All you need to do is reach out to the appropriate authority, hand over the evidence, and wait for the results.</p>" +
          "<p>The company responsible for recovering your funds have to review all the evidence, ascertain whether or not fraud has taken place, confront the alleged scammers, and get the funds back. Naturally, this requires a lot of knowledge, resources, and time, so you may find yourself waiting a while. Even if fraud can be proven, getting the money back isn’t always easy.</p>" +
          "<h2>How Long Does A Chargeback Take?</h2>" +
          "<p>How long it takes depends entirely on how you’re trying to reclaim your funds. The PayPal PayPal chargeback time limit will be different from a bank chargeback, and the same goes for your credit card.</p>" +
          "<p>The truth is, chargebacks are rather complex, and can take as long as 45 days; in some cases, they can take even longer than that. Depending on the amount of money taken, the nature of the chargeback – whether it’s from your bank or a site like PayPal – you may even be waiting as long as six months. There is no one answer, so be sure to ask the company that’s performing the chargeback. You might find that the amount isn’t worth the wait, or that it’ll come in quicker than you thought it would.</p>" +
          "<h2>Pros and Cons of Chargebacks</h2>" +
          "<h3>Pros</h3>" +
          "<p><b>Funds Recovery:</b> Obviously, the best part about doing a chargeback is that you can get back the money that you’ve lost. For some, the amount taken can be huge, especially if you’ve fallen for investment scams. Getting back your lost cash is a huge relief and means you don’t have to spend years possibly trying to rebuild it.</p>" +
          "<p><b>You’re Sending A Message:</b> It might seem like all is lost if you’ve been scammed, but the truth is, you stand a solid chance of getting your funds back. Though it might not seem too important, you’re also sending the message that you won’t be scammed again, not least by the same broker or individual. That means you’re less likely to be hassled in the future.</p>" +
          "<p><b>You Can Keep Your Reputation:</b> If your decisions mean your company is scammed, the last thing you want is to get your reputation ruined, or for rival businesses to find out what’s happened. Getting a chargeback means you can quietly reclaim your funds without having to let everyone know what’s gone wrong.</p>" +
          "<p><b>There Are No Guarantees:</b> Chargebacks don’t work every time, and yours isn’t a guarantee either. If the scammer has already relocated your funds, it’s very unlikely that you’ll see them again. The faster you move, and the quicker you contact a chargeback company, the more chance you have to get your money back.</p>" +
          "<p><b>It’ll Cost You:</b> Depending on how much the money is that you’ve lost, the fees for using a chargeback company might mean it’s best to chalk this one up to a loss and learn from it. Of course, if you’re doing your chargeback through your bank or PayPal, then the only resource you’ll be spending is time.</p>" +
          "<h2>How To Do A Chargeback</h2>" +
          "<p>The process of initiating a chargeback is simple enough. Read on for the three simple steps you’ll need to follow.</p>" +
          "<h3>Step 1 – Reach Out:</h3>" +
          "<p>The company or entity that originally held the funds that have been lost is where you turn to. For example, if you’ve been hit by an advance fee scam using funds from your debit account, then turn to the bank or fintech company that issued this account. That being said, if you want to go directly through a chargeback company like Payback LTD to increase your chances of recovery, then this is also an option.</p>" +
          "<h3>Step 2 – File Your Dispute:</h3>" +
          "<p>When filing a dispute, be sure to give your reasoning, as well as the account, transaction, and any evidence associated with your case. The more information you give, the smoother the whole process will be, and it’ll no doubt make the team’s job easier that’s working on your case.</p>" +
          "<h3>Step 3 – Wait For The Results:</h3>" +
          "<p>At this point, there’s not much else you can do other than wait for the outcome. You might find that more evidence or reason is needed from the fraud team, but other than that, the best thing you can do is allow the experts to do their job.</p>" +
          "<h2>Using Chargebacks To Recover Your Funds From Investment Scams</h2>" +
          "<ul class=\"ab__rs-list\">" +
          "<li><b>Chargebacks For The Forex Market:</b> You don’t have to have your money stolen to initiate a Forex chargeback. The quality of service and the choices a broker makes are also valid reasons. Brokers withholding your funds for personal gain is the more common example of Forex chargebacks, however. </li>" +
          "<li><b>Chargebacks For The Binary Options Market:</b> Just like with Forex, binary options is a sector where scams and scam firms are incredibly common. That’s why chargeback is so essential for this market.</li>" +
          "<li><b>Chargebacks For The Cryptocurrency Market:</b> The crypto market is relatively new, and since a lot of cryptos are always being made following the successes of Bitcoin, people of all competencies are using them. Plus, the lack of traceability with crypto means scams are rife here. Chargebacks can reclaim your funds in the event a shady platform or broker has taken them.</li>" +
          "</ul>" +

We’ll explore what NFT scams are exactly, how they work, who’s being targeted most often (hint: it’s not who you’d think), and how to avoid them.</p>" +
          "<h3>What is an NFT token and how does it relate to cryptocurrencies?</h3>" +
          "<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that have unique properties. This means they’re not interchangeable and can’t be duplicated like traditional cryptocurrencies. Unlike a cryptocurrency’s coins with their predetermined supply limit (only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist), NFTs’ value is determined by the number of people who want them for whatever it is they do.</p>" +
          "<h3>How does an NFT token work?</h3>" +
          "<p>An ERC-20 token contract defines what makes each coin different from another–its name, symbol, decimal amount in ETH/BTC, total supply cap etcetera–while also defining how to transfer ownership between parties on the blockchain. These technology standards allow any Ethereum address to store multiple types of coins, each of which is differentiated by a different NFT.</p>" +
          "<p>The most popular ERC-20 token standard right now is the non-fungible Ethereum’s native currency called ETH, and this system works as long as everyone agrees on what an “ETH” actually means in terms of value or function. But if you’re designing your own tokens to represent something else–gold coins for example–then it becomes necessary to provide more detail about how they work, so that people know exactly what they can do with them.</p>" +
          "<h3>What makes NFTs valuable?</h3>" +
          "<p>NFTs are valuable because there aren’t very many like them out there: In this way they differ from traditional currencies which have unlimited supplies.</p>" +
          "<p>This is where the idea of scarcity comes into play, and that’s why NFTs can be considered a type of commodity rather than just money. Scarcity creates value in any market by limiting supply to drive up demand, but with NFTs it also means you don’t know what else might crop up at some point–particularly if your NFT represents something physical such as an artwork or piece of land–so its price can continue to go up even after an initial high-value purchase. This is especially true for assets whose rarity isn’t naturally determined by nature (e.g. gold) but rather by a human-created process (e.g. money printing).</p>" +
          "<p>NFT scams are on the rise as more people enter crypto and NFTs become a new frontier for fraudsters to explore–even though they’ve been around since 2017 when CryptoKitties became one of the first NFT games with real economic value, followed soon after by Rare Pepe Wallet cards</p>" +
          "<p>In less than two years these non-fungible tokens have already gone mainstream: There’s an entire industry devoted to them now that includes art galleries, auctions, in-game purchases made through smart contracts, even trading card game tournaments where rare items can be worth tens of thousands or even millions of dollars.</p>" +
          "<h3>Is NFT crypto fraud real?</h3>" +
          "<p>So if an NFT is a digital collectible that’s not worth anything until somebody decides to buy it, then what happens when people trade them without realizing they’re worthless? Owning something risky and having its value suddenly drop is one thing, but what about the 100% purely unadulterated con artists who are playing in the NFT space.<br>" +
          "A NFT scam, which is a form of fraud that takes place in the crypto world when an unscrupulous individual sells someone something they know is not worth anything. The seller just wants to make a quick buck and will tell you whatever lies it takes for them to get your money. This sounds like a scam as old as time with an NFT they can happen faster, and be larger than anyone could’ve imagined at their outset.<br>" +
          "The best-known NFT scam targeted a game called CryptoKitties, which is the most popular NFT. The seller took some of their own “fake” cats and put them up for sale in order to drive down the value of other players’ assets. This was an insider attack that involved someone who knew what they were doing–a well-meaning person would have been outed as soon as they started manipulating prices because every transaction has a publicly viewable price history on Etherscan.io, but this person had no such intention.<br>" +
          "This CryptoKitties “scam” is really just a competition for control over the price of NFTs. It can happen in many other games, too–even those with more centralized economies and less open markets–because these kinds of scams are all about manipulating prices through supply and demand. When there’s only one person or company controlling supply, monopolistic practices like this have long been known to create an opportunity for manipulation that harms consumers without any benefit to themselves. The lack of transparency around pricing makes it harder to see what’s happening because their stocks stay high-priced as they sell off inventory, creating shortages that drive up prices further still.</p>" +
          "<h3>Why are NFTs vulnerable to scams?</h3>" +
          "<p>Non-fungible tokens are especially vulnerable to scams because they are governed by less than open markets. The lack of transparency around pricing makes it harder to see what’s happening because their stocks stay high-priced as they sell off inventory, creating shortages that drive up prices further still.<br>" +
          "Non-fungible tokens are especially vulnerable to these types of manipulations because they are governed by open markets which means you can easily see the results in real time without going through any middlemen like an auction house. It also opens up some big questions about how we should regulate smart contracts like these so that people don’t find themselves being ripped off.</p>" +
          "<h3>Recovering from an NFT scammer</h3>" +

            "<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged an agent working for 1 Global Capital, LLC for violations concerning the trading of unregistered securities there. The SEC accused him of selling more than $10.8 million worth of securities which were not registered with the commission, to several unsuspecting investors.</p>" +
            "<p>1 Global made high-interest loans to small businesses akin to high interest “payday” loans. 1 Global originated loans to investors by selling contracts for future placement of money on equities investment bank deposits. The unregistered securities consisted of shares that should have (which totaled more than $10 million) disposed to unsuspecting customers, who were simply looking for short-term investments. Financial advisers and other intermediates were promised significant commissions if they helped 1 Global raise money.</p>" +
            "<p>The SEC claims that he unlawfully sold more than $10.8 million worth of unregistered securities to investors through a company called 1 Global Capital LLC</p>" +
            "<p>He has been accused of selling unregistered securities to several unsuspecting investors with promises of shares in principal repayments.</p>" +
            "<h3>Recognizing Securities Fraud</h3>" +
            "<p><b>1. How the SEC protects investors and the importance of their oversight</b><br>" +
            "There are many steps that investors can take to protect themselves against fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a government agency committed to protecting all Americans from securities fraud, which includes misrepresentations made by brokerage firms regarding investments or financial products.<br>" +
            "The SEC has been successful in prosecuting individuals who have perpetrated such crimes, yet there remains room for improvement when it comes to enforcement efforts surrounding investment advisers and other intermediates. This poses a challenge as these intermediaries often receive incentives for bringing new clients into fund management businesses. A lack of action on this front could facilitate more investor victimization while also creating an uneven playing field within the markets with individual brokers driven less by ethics than competition-driven monetary interests.<br>" +
            "<b>2. The difference between fraud and manipulation</b><br>" +
            "There is a significant difference between fraud and manipulation. Fraud is when a broker makes false claims about the value of an investment. Manipulation, on the other hand, is when brokers use various tactics to get their own trades executed at favorable prices or to prevent any unfavorable execution for themselves.<br>" +
            "<b>3. When to report securities fraud to the SEC</b><br>" +
            "If you believe you’ve been a victim of securities fraud, there are a few things you should do. First, document what happened and how much money was lost as well as the date and time of your investment. Next, call or email the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to report securities fraud by submitting a complaint form online: https://www.sec.gov/tcr<br>" +
            "<b>4. Examples of fraudulent activity in financial markets</b><br>" +
            "Unfortunately the list of frauds in the financial markets is endless, ranging from outright theft to widespread manipulation and insider trading.<br>" +
            "The following are some examples of fraudulent activity in financial markets:</p>" +
            "<ul class=\"main__marker-list\">" +
            "<li>Touting stocks by publishing false information about a company or its prospects</li>" +
            "<li>Falsely reporting the prices at which orders were executed on an exchange for personal gain (slipping)</li>" +
            "<li>Deliberately sending misleading signals through communications channels such as chatrooms, instant messaging services and message boards (pump & dump scheme)</li>" +
            "<li>Stealing money from trading accounts by obtaining unauthorized access using passwords obtained through social engineering techniques</li>" +
            "<li>Siphoning funds from clients’ investment portfolios with falsified balance statements</li>" +
            "<li>Simply selling securities, when you are neither a registered broker or securities professional</li>" +
            "</ul>" +
            "<h3>Recovering money from securities fraud</h3>" +
            "<p><b>1. How to recover money from securities fraud</b><br>" +
            "Securities fraud is a federal crime and, as such, there are clear repercussions for those who break the law. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has established guidelines on how to recover money from securities fraud that you may have lost or invested in due to the criminal activities of someone else<br>" +
            "They suggest contacting an attorney immediately after discovering suspicious activity, so they can file a complaint with FINRA’s Office of Investigations. You should also keep records about your losses so if this happens again but at another company you’ll be able to show evidence supporting your claims. This will allow them to more easily issue refunds without going through lengthy investigations themselves.<br>" +
            "<b>2. The process of recovering your money through the courts</b><br>" +
            "The process for recovering your money can be a long and arduous one. The first step is hiring a lawyer to file an arbitration claim and being able to show evidence of the fraud<br>" +
            "The next steps could include filing for bankruptcy, which will protect your assets when creditors come knocking on your door; this is also important because you’ll need proof that you couldn’t pay back what was owed in order to avoid criminal prosecution.<br>" +
            "After obtaining legal protection, if anyone tries to collect from you, they can be sued or arrested by law enforcement agencies who have jurisdiction over these cases. You may want to check with them first before taking any action against individual debt collectors.<br>" +
            "<b>3. Why you should hire a professional</b><br>" +
            "You could try to go it alone in recovering your money but not hiring a professional likely contributed to you being in this mess in the first place. PayBack Ltd is a company that specializes in recovering money from those who owe it to you.<br>" +
            "Their services are designed for people like you, so the chances of a successful recovery will be much higher than if you tried on your own with no specific experience or training.<br>" +
            "Rather than trying to collect the debt all by yourself and risking being taken advantage of again, let PayBack ltd do everything for you!</p>",

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">The Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bans Binary Options</h1>" +
            "<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has now officially announced that they will be banning binary options to retail investors. This means that no company in Australia can offer these services to anyone who is not a professional investor, or those with significant experience trading in this type of financial instrument.</p>" +
            "<p>This decision is in line with the other countries who have taken similar measures, and it follows a study of binary options by ASIC. This research found that many Australian investors lost money when trading these financial products; nearly one quarter of them didn’t make back any at all. In addition to this, some people were paying more than they made for trades from brokers – which means their losses actually increased as time went on. The risk was too great for most Australians investing in binaries because there wasn’t enough protection if things go wrong.</p>" +
            "<p>The ban has been called “a win” for consumers by experts outside the industry, but some inside argue that banning binary options may just push the market underground or into unregulated areas where control efforts are difficult or ineffective.</p>" +
            "<h2>A quick summary:</h2>" +
            "<ul class=\"main__marker-list\">" +
            "<li>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has banned binary options</li>" +
            "<li>ASIC Commissioner John Price said, “It is too easy for people to lose large sums of money through this type of trading”. He added that there are a number of risks associated with binary options including the risk of fraud, market manipulation, and other criminal activity</li>" +
            "<li>Binary options providers have been given until March 21st to cease operations in Australia or face fines up to $220 million dollars</li>" +
            "<li>They may also be required to repay any funds they have taken from Australians since October 2016</li>" +
            "<li>If you are an investor who lost money due to fraudulent investment schemes involving binary options please contact ASIC at 1800 065 943 for assistance in recovering your losses</li>" +
            "</ul>" +
            "<h2>So, what are binary options?</h2>" +
            "<p>Binary option trading is a form of investment where the value of an asset (usually shares) are predicted to go up or down by one predetermined amount. Binary options can be traded on any underlying market, such as currencies, commodities and stocks.</p>" +
            "<p>The investor will decide how much they want to invest in the trade and then select how long their contract lasts for- anywhere between 30 seconds up to 12 months. They also need to predict if the price of the asset will rise above or drop below a certain level before it expires.</p>" +
            "<h2>How do binary options work and why are they risky?</h2>" +
            "<p>Binary options work by predicting if the price of an asset will rise or fall by a predetermined amount. If they are correct, then their profit is fixed and known at the time they enter into the contract.</p>" +
            "<p>If they’re wrong, however-and prices go in the opposite direction to their prediction-they lose all of their money.</p>" +
            "<p>The reason that this type of trading can be considered risky is because it involves substantial risk for small rewards. For every winning trade there’s likely going to be many more losing trades which could mean investors incur significant financial losses on binary options trading before ever making any real gains.</p>" +
            "<h2>Why is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission banning them</h2>" +
            "<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has taken a significant step in protecting investors from the dangers of binary options trading. Their decision was made largely because too many Australians have been ripped off by unscrupulous brokers.</p>" +
            "<p>This new ruling will prohibit any company that offers or advertises investments into binary option contracts on an Australian market from operating in Australia. This ban includes all companies regardless of where they’re based, but does not extend to overseas markets such as US-based financial exchanges like NASDAQ or NYSE Arca.</p>" +
            "<h2>The legal implications of using binary options in Australia</h2>" +
            "<p>Some of the legal implications of the ban will be far reaching. Brokers will no longer be able to use email, telephone or social media solicitation for potential investors in the country.</p>" +
            "<p>This new ruling is going help protect Aussie traders from these types of investments because it bans companies with bad business practices from soliciting customers via means such as marketing materials like emails, social media posts and phone.</p>" +
            "<h2>What you can do if you've already invested in a binary option and want to recover your money</h2>" +
            "<p>If you’ve already invested in or lost money investing in binary options, it is possible to recover your money.</p>" +
            "<p>First, you need to understand that binary options are not a regulated product in Australia; this means Australian regulatory authorities cannot offer investors any form of protection against fraud or scams when it comes to binary option trading.</p>" +
            "<p>To find out which company is legitimate and trustworthy, the best thing you can do is research on reputable platforms like ASIC’s website because they list all companies that are deemed as safe investment opportunities for Aussie traders.</p>" +
            "<p>Next, you can contact a professional recovery company like PayBack ltd, the world’s leading provider of investor recovery and support services for victims of investment fraud, with over 20 years experience in helping people who have lost money on investments they trusted or were recommended to them by binary options brokers. <br> Its important that you get your money back, so don’t delay.

            "<h3>What is a romance scam?</h3>" +
            "<p>Depending on how you look at it, there couldn’t be a worse or more opportunistic time for romance scams to occur – especially in the last year. We’ve all been hunkered down in some place around the world due to lockdowns, and this has had a huge effect on the way we live; for some, in unimaginable ways. Something most people can agree on is that interacting with people hasn’t been a possibility for a while now. Speaking to strangers beyond supermarket cashiers just hasn’t been on the cards. And we’re not all lucky enough to have people at home to keep us sane – whether that’s family, friends, or someone we’re in a relationship with.</p>" +
            "<p>For most of us, finding love isn’t easy at the best of times. During a pandemic? Anyone looking to find their life partner is forced to turn to dating apps, and not all of them are reliable or as legitimate as the big names (we all know what they are). I’m sure we can all imagine that this can lead to some really unfortunate situations. While some of us are more privy to the ways of internet dating and online romance scams than others, the same can’t be said for everyone; especially those that are new to the online dating game and are slightly more desperate than others.</p>" +
            "<p>I mean, when you consider that those over 200 million dollars were lost to romance scams in 2019 alone, you start to realize just how much love scams are a real thing. Look at Australia – of the 83 million AUD lost in 2019 to these scams, 33% of those took place on social media. So you don’t even have to be operating on dating apps.</p>" +
            "<h3>How Can You Tell if Someone is a Romance Scammer?</h3>" +
            "<p>This is likely one of the most saddening online scams – people that get stung are simply looking for companionship, and have a lot of affection to give. They have so much affection to give that they’re prepared to ignore the obvious signs that come with sharing huge amounts of cash – or any amount of cash for that matter – with people they can’t verify to be legitimate and have never even met. In order to avoid these scams, you need to know what to look for. Besides the obvious – like not allowing your need for love to skew your better judgment and part with your savings – there are various signs to consider. How well a person can speak the local language of a country they pertain to be from is a huge one, for example.</p>" +
            "<p>Anyway, look out for the telltale signs; they exist. They might be more obvious to some readers, but each one is important to include. Read on to see what they are.</p>" +
            "<p><b>Love Is In The Air (Too Quickly):</b> If someone’s professing their love for you quickly, keep your wits about you. This is an obvious sign of an internet love scam. You think you’re the only person they’re trying to get money from? They’re trying to wrap things up as quickly as possible, and if they don’t succeed with you, they’re onto the next sorry soul.</p>" +
            "<p><b>Incomplete Profiles:</b> It’s true, some of us prefer to have as little information as possible on our profiles, and that’s okay. But if the person you’re talking to has a couple of sketchy, bad-quality images, and doesn’t have localized information – like schools or places of work you’re familiar with, stay away.</p>" +
            "<p><b>There’s An Emergency:</b> This is all-to-common across all online scams, especially internet romance scams. The pleasantries of getting to properly know one another are out the window because low and behold, they have a family emergency. Hospital bills; fear of eviction; travel: these are just some of the excuses you can expect, and you’ll hear them far sooner than you should feel comfortable with. Don’t ignore your instinct.</p>" +
            "<h3>How To Outsmart A Romantic Scammer</h3>" +
            "<p>Honestly, outsmarting them entirely depends on how aware you are of their practices. The key tip here isn’t just knowing how romance scammers operate, but how your average online scammer will try and separate you from your money too. Whether it’s a Nigerian prince scam or anything similar, you’ll do yourself a huge favor by getting to grips with the obvious signs of any scammer.</p>" +
            "<p>Something you’ll notice is that the approaches used in these types of scams are remarkably similar; those that involve a scammer actually interacting with you, that is. Why? Because they’re relying on you. Ultimately, it’s you that has to give up your cash; it’s you that has to go along with it and feel guilty about the circumstances they’re telling you. It doesn’t have to be love – most romance scammers don’t wait long enough for you to start feeling any emotions. Feelings of loneliness, desperation, the need for human contact – this is what they’re counting on.</p>" +
            "<p>They rely entirely on you to be desperate for love and not wise to their ways. The best thing you can do is familiarize yourself with the telltale signs of how these scammers operate and don’t act with your heart; use your head. Never send anyone money you don’t know, especially when you can’t verify their existence and their profile clearly looks shady. We all know what a real profile looks like; and, let’s be honest, no real person on these apps is gonna ask for your money anyway.</p>" +
            "<p>The real way to outsmart them, though, is by protecting other users. Don’t just move on – report any profile you see to be acting this way. There’s no doubt that they operate a massive number of profiles, but any profile you can get banned means associated email addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles can’t be used anymore.</p>" +
            "<h3>What Information Does A Romance Scammer Need?</h3>" +
            "<p>Truth be told, scammers don’t need a lot of information from you. What they really need is for you to go well out your way to send them money. They don’t need your bank account details for this, nor do they need any personal information.</p>" +
            "<p>Actually, two of the most common methods you’ll come across are sending gift card codes to the person requesting them and making direct wire transfers via Western Union Bank. Both are entirely unsolvable, so be wary when sending anyone money or credit of any kind via these methods that you’ve never met. That isn’t to say that every instance is a scam, it’s just that if anyone is asking you to send money via these methods, especially so soon after matching on dating apps, you’re really unlikely to ever see that money back. The person you’re speaking to, who’s asking you to hand over money during this scam, in 99% of cases, isn’t the person you’re looking to help anyway. Having their Western Union details won’t help you, either, since it doesn’t act like a real bank. A person can withdraw this money as soon as you send it and never action that account again.</p>" +
            "<p>Now, if you get access to a real bank account, there’s a solid chance you can redeem these funds, and that’s where Payback LTD comes in.</p>" +
            "<h3>Reporting A Romance Scam and Getting Your Money Back!</h3>" +
            "<p>Just because being scammed involves romance – doesn’t mean you should be too embarrassed to say anything about it. In fact, there are companies, like us, that might actually be able to get your money back, and we don’t judge! We don’t care how you got scammed or why you handed the money over – all we care about is doing what we can to get your money back</p>" +

            "<h2>The Anatomy Of The Nigerian Scam: Past And Present</h2>" +
            "<p>What is a Nigerian scam? Well, there’s more than one out there, and most of us have heard about at least one kind – whether through the recurring jokes people make at its expense, or an attempt has been sent to our own inboxes. In case you haven’t guessed it yet, we’re talking about the Nigerian prince scam which, as of a 2019 study, is said to still rake in more than $700,000 every year. The chance to help struggling royalty flee their country is seemingly still an effective tale to get people to part with their cash.But as stated above, this isn’t the only scam to come from Nigeria, and the tactics and methods used have come a long way to ensuring this remains a lucrative, mostly untraceable industry. The advanced fee scam, for example, which is also known as ‘419’, has secured over $82 Billion to date, with millions of people worldwide having been affected.</p>" +
            "<p>Though these crimes are typically done by syndicates, lone actors aren’t uncommon. One man, known as Raymond Abbas, is responsible for stealing $431 million through phishing scams until he was arrested; another gained $40 million by targeting Chicago-based businesses, and these are just two of the people arrested in 2020. Typically, it’s high-achieving professionals that are the most likely to fall for these types of ploys.</p>" +
            "<p>While some types of Nigerian scams are simple in nature, like 419 fraud, others are slightly more sophisticated, as the need to adapt strategies has become essential to the success of scams and also avoiding capture. Nigeria’s crime watch authorities are privy to all of them. There’s everything from fake auctions and charities to eCommerce stores meant entirely to take your cash.</p>" +

            "<h2>Why Does Nigeria Have So Many Scams?</h2>" +
            "<p>There’s no one answer to this question. Though the country is known for having a huge network of scamming operations, some operating in groups and others not, for the most part, its made up of honest, hardworking, and decent people. Without going too much into the disparity of wealth in Nigeria, a big part of why this began happening is desperation and the need to source income from somewhere. Of course, greed plays a role too.</p>" +
            "<p>Put simply, Nigerian money scams became a thing because people fall for them. The people that started this whole thing were able to prey on people’s best intentions and goodwill without putting hardly any effort into their attempts, and thus, a gap in the market was filled. Naturally, the network grew as more people realized what money can be made. Let’s be honest, if you don’t work, you can treat scamming as a full-time job, and eventually, you’re likely to get some people to fall for your attempts.</p>" +
            "<p>At first, all countries were pretty slow on the uptake, which meant this sort of scamming went relatively unchecked in the beginning. The money taken from targeting individuals with advanced-fee schemes pales in comparison to the amount stolen from corporations. Of course, this is what really caught the attention of organizations everywhere, not just in Nigeria itself.</p>" +
            "<p>Now, having caught the attention of existing federal bodies, like the FBI, task forces have been set up to take down the most prolific scammers, in Nigeria and various countries that are affected. Unfortunately, though, the smaller amounts scammed from everyday people like us still go relatively unchecked by these organizations; but that isn’t to say there aren’t ways of retrieving your cash.</p>" +
            "<h2>Where To Report Nigerian Internet Scams</h2>" +
            "<p>This depends entirely on where you’re based, but all countries will have a relevant authority that you can turn to to report your recent scamming. Reporting to the Nigerian federal authorities won’t really get you anywhere, as they’ll work on a cross-agency basis, and likely won’t respond to individual cases. This may be worth a try if you’d like to give it a go, however.</p>" +
            "<p>Really, you’re likely best reporting to your own federal authortiy, but don’t get your hopes up on getting your money back. You absolutely should report it, but this will do more to put the scammer out of action and save the next person from falling for what you did. Information for authorities in some of the most affected countries can be found below.</p>" +

            "<h2>Police Arrest Two & End $1.7 Million Forex Scam In India</h2>" +
            "<p>A major India-based Forex scam has seen two men arrested in Chennai for operating a sophisticated Ponzi scheme. The 34 and 41-year-old have been running two websites since at least 2019, ultimately scamming $1.7 million out of around 70,000 people across the country. The only reason the bust took place was that one unfortunate person lost out on the equivalent of $15,000 through the scam.</p>" +
            "<p>To have obtained such a massive amount of cash in such a short space of time shows that not only are people not comfortable with coming forward, but many likely also don’t even know that they’re being scammed. Just as you’d expect, the people that were scammed were enticed by joining a high-returning low-effort FX scheme; actually, what was happening, was that the money sent for investments was actually being sent directly into the scammers’ accounts. Part of this cash was then used to pay small amounts to investors to maintain the illusion of trading, just like with any thought-out Ponzi scheme, which is likely what allowed them to maintain the operation for so long.</p>" +
            "<p>As I’m sure you can imagine, this one instance of Forex scamming alone is enough to show the importance of using reputable brokers. The damage can be huge, and if the fraudsters are sophisticated enough, there’s a good chance you might never realize that the reason for your losses can be blamed on anything but a bad market. Read on to learn more about the importance of choosing a broker wisely and how you can get your money back if you’ve been scammed.</p>" +
            "<h2>The Importance Of Using Reputable Brokers</h2>" +
            "<p>India is one of the most prolific countries in the world when it comes to Ponzi schemes and other such scams, like pyramid schemes, but it’s certainly not the only one. One of the reasons it’s so common for people to get stung is because the people running these scams aren’t alone – they’re often huge networks of people, sometimes even operating out of an office building, working day in day out to get people to sign up for their schemes. Essentially, this system works by cold calling hundreds of people a day and offering a new service or asking you to switch out an existing provider for them.</p>" +
            "<p>In the case of forex trading, these pretend brokers will lure you in by promising massive returns on small investments. Perhaps you’re unsatisfied with your existing broker, or would like to get into trading but don’t know enough about how to get started – all scam brokers, whether from India or not, will look to capitalize on these ways of thinking, as well as the desire that most people have: to get rich, and to get rich quick.</p>" +
            "<p>The importance of using reputable brokers really can’t be stressed enough. Oftentimes, knowing which brokers are reputable and which ones aren’t is where people go wrong. That means doing your own research and using whatever advice you can get is equally essential. If you’re enticed by outrageously low fees, ask yourself: how is a broker making its money if it’s not charging much for transactions.</p>" +
            "<p>Another important sign to watch out for is whether or not they use any kind of client vetting process, and if they limit the number of clients they use or not. This shows they only have money on their mind, and that doesn’t mean making you any. If you’re unsure about using small-scale investment brokers and would prefer to make your own trades, major platforms like Binance Academy are a good place to start.</p>" +

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Cash App Fraud: The Threat and What You Can Do</h1>" +
            "<p>What is cash app fraud? Cash App Fraud occurs when a person uses someone else’s account information to send or receive funds. It may also include the use of a stolen credit card and using it to purchase Bitcoin which is then sent to their own cash app wallet. The most common form of Cash App Fraud happens when an individual downloads the Cash App, verifies their email address with their phone number but doesn’t input any other personal information. This leaves them vulnerable as they can be bombarded with spam messages from scammers posing as Cash App representatives who are requesting additional verification information in order for them to “verify” your account (i.e., your name, date-of-birth).</p>" +
            "<h2>How does Cash App work?</h2>" +
            "<p>Users download the Cash App for either iOS or Android devices. They sign up using their email address and phone number to create a Cash App account that is verified by a six-character password, PIN code, and touch ID on iPhones. Once this is done, they can then use cash app’s services: Send funds to anyone with an email; request money from friends via text message or through social media posts (Facebook Messenger).</p>" +
            "<p>Some of the benefits of using cash app are that it is free to use. There are no fees for sending money or converting from cash to digital currency within the Cash App account as long as it’s under $20,000 and not connected with a bank transfer. Cash app allows you access your funds anytime – even without an internet connection!</p>" +
            "<p>The downsides to cash app are that you have to pay a fee for transferring money from your Cash App account to a bank account. You also have to find someone with cash app who will buy bitcoin in order to purchase items that are not available on the mobile marketplaces.</p>" +
            "<p>Cash app is linked directly, and has access, with Square’s credit card processing system which helps make it easier for customers without traditional bank accounts or checks. This leads into some of the risks: passwords can be used by hackers if they “guessed” or were given them; there is no protection against fraud – whether via email scams (phishing)or stolen credentials because all information including username/email address/pin code/touch ID is stored remotely.</p>" +
            "<h2>Can you be scammed on Cash App?</h2>" +
            "<p>Scammers can easily pose as Cash App employees or users and contact you to request your personal information</p>" +
            "<h3>What can I do to protect myself?</h3>" +
            "<p>Don’t give out sensitive information on the app if they ask for it; verify that a message is from an official Cash App account by checking the blue checkmark next to their name. Fraudsters pretend to be Cash App and they say they need your password or PIN so they can steal your money. Some scam artists will outright ask for personal information and others work up to it; this is how fraudsters get themselves authorized to take your money. Never share your Cash App information with anyone!</p>" +
            "<h3>How long does cash app verification take?</h3>" +
            "<p>Cash App will send you a text message with a code once your identity has been verified using this method. Once you’ve received that text, copy it into the box found within Settings – Security & Privacy – Verified Phone Numbers and press “Verify”. Then click “Confirm”.</p>" +
            "<h3>What happens if you get tricked or scammed on Cash App?</h3>" +
            "<p>If you get scammed on Cash App, know that you are not alone. Scams on Cash App have been on the rise, including fraudulent cash-outs as well as spoof emails and text messages that appear to be from Cash App.</p>" +
            "<p>Wade Hankins is a landlord based in Raleigh, North Carolina and he used the Cash App to collect rent payments from his tenants. Someone called him claiming to be from Cash App and said they would help him get his money out of the app and into his back account.  Unfortunately, they were only helping themselves to his money.  He lost over $20,000 to these unscrupulous thieves.  Another man from California reported this year that scammers fooled him into creating fake refunds and then used money from his regular bank account to buy over $20,000 in bitcoin.  Cash App fraud is real and according to Apptopia, fraud on the app is up over 300% from this time last year.</p>" +
            "<p>If you end up getting scammed on Cash App there is very little the company can do to help you track down your money.  They lack the resources and even the tech to track the fraudsters who tricked you.  In essence, you’re on your own!</p>" +
            "<p>How do I report fraud on Cash app?</p>" +
            "<p>If you think that someone has tried to trick you into giving them money or your personal information, please change your Cash App PIN so no one can access it. Then report the incident to Cash App Support here: https://cash.app/contact</p>" +
            "<p>Next, contact your local law enforcement agency right away so they can start their own investigation into what happened and how it could be prevented in the future.</p>" +
            "<h3>How to protect your Cash App account from fraud?</h3>" +
            "<p>Verify that the Cash app you downloaded is an official version of Cash App. It should say “CashApp” in green lettering on a white or grey background with no other colors or patterns.</p>" +
            "<p>Do not respond to any messages, texts, emails, etc., requesting personal information like date-of-birth and social security number for verification purposes; this will likely be part of the scammer’s strategy to gain access to your accounts Don’t click any links in emails or texts that you weren’t expecting.</p>" +
            "<p>Do not take the bait if your Cash App account is blocked and someone who appears to be from Cash App contacts you. If it’s a legitimate request, they will have sent an email rather than contacting you directly through social media or text messages.</p>" +
            "<p>Always double-check before clicking on anything like links, attachments, etc., as these can often lead to malware downloads onto your device.</p>" +
            "<p>Never share your Cash app username and password with anyone else; this includes sharing them via “email recall” within the app because this could also result in fraud taking place against your account. Remember: Sharing passwords allows criminals access to all of our accounts at once!</p>" +
            "<h3>How to get money back from cash app fraud?</h3>" +
            "<p>On your own there is very little you can do, and as discussed above, there is very little that the company or its employees can do – or are willing to do. That’s where professional recovery services come in. Companies like PayBack ltd. specialize in recovering lost funds from all types of fraud cases, including those involving cash app.</p>" +
            "<p>The best way to recover your money is by contacting a recovery service even before you decide to contact Cash App customer support and asking them for their professional advice on how to go about getting back the stolen funds.

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Learn About Mail Fraud So You Don’t Get Scammed in 2021!</h1>" +
            "<h2>What Constitutes Mail Fraud?</h2>" +
            "<p>Mail fraud simply refers to any type of attempted fraud that’s submitted via the postal system. In the US, this constitutes as a federal and serious crime, not least for the damage it causes. Since it crosses both state and international lines, any mail fraud penalty will be severe, carrying a maximum of $1 million in fines and and up to 30 years in prison. </p>" +
            "<p>The three markers of mail fraud are: </p>" +
            "<h3>Depriving Someone</h3>" +
            "<p>The act of committing mail fraud isn’t complete without depriving someone of the thing they’ve worked the hardest for: their money. Manipulation and reliance on the naivety and good will of others are essential components when it comes to parting people with their money, so as you can imagine, it takes a real special breed of person to turn to scamming, no matter how desperate people can be. </p>" +
            "<h3>Scheme To Defraud</h3>" +
            "<p>For any plan to succeed, there has to be a strategy in place. Over time, there’s been a range of tried-and-tested ways of committing both local and international mail fraud, many of which you’ve likely heard of. </p>" +
            "<p>A typical scheme will create a sense of urgency or fear on the part of the receiver, either to send over banking details or to directly forward money via an untraceable payment system like Western Union. The scammer will likely imitate an official company you’re affiliated with or imitate a charity or an organization running a competition.</p>" +
            "<h3>The Use Of Mail</h3>" +
            "<p>As mentioned above and no doubt the most obvious marker, the postal system has to be used for any such scam to be labelled as mail fraud. This is especially important because it’s what enables a government to punish mail fraud cases. If it’s committed over the phone or, in most cases, via email, and money is forwarded to the fraudster, it’s likely that no charges will be brought forward. </p>" +
            "<h2>Common Examples Of Mail Fraud</h2>" +
            "<h3>Ponzi Schemes</h3>" +
            "<p>There’s a reason we shouldn’t trust everything we hear, and that’s an especially important rule in business. Ponzi schemes date as far back to the mid 1800s, even before the name was coined. Under the impression of buying into the next-best business opportunity, innocent people are suckered into parting with their cash on several occasions, simply to line the pockets of the so-called ‘Ponzi’, who then cuts and runs. This is one of the most common mail fraud scams there is. </p>" +
            "<h3>Identity Theft</h3>" +
            "<p>It can all go wrong in no time at all when it comes to identity theft, and a surprisingly small amount of information is needed to execute it. A few biographical details is all they need to take out loans in your name, to clear out your bank accounts, and to even commit criminal acts in your name. Due to the slow-moving nature of the postal system, by the time your accounts are cleared and you’re being hauled in for charges, the scammers are already eyeing up their next mark. </p>" +
            "<h3>Fraudulent Documentation</h3>" +
            "<p>This could be any documentation that requires forwarding money directly to a sender or, more likely, handing over your banking details. The letters will look just like anything you’d expect to see from your ISP or car insurance policy provider, except they serve only to part you with your personal information. This is one of the common methods used for stealing a person’s identity, also. </p>" +
            "<h2>Tips To Protect Yourself</h2>" +
            "<ul class=\"main__marker-list\">" +
            "<li><div>Don't Leave Bills In Your Mailbox:</div>Leaving mail with personal information on it, like bills, is exactly how scammers know what types of fraudulent documentation to send you, how they commit identity fraud, and how they pick you as the person for their next scam. Be sure to get your mail as soon as possible, and this goes for sending too: don’t trust anyone to get your post where it needs to go.</li>" +
            "<li><div>Don't Respond To Suspicious Letters:</div>This is mail fraud 101. Anything you’re unsure of, the last thing you want to do is hand over your personal details or banking information. You wouldn’t do this with a suspicious person, would you? If you’re ever unsure, simply give a quick call to the company that a letter claims to be sent by and get confirmation first. Usually, you’ll know to expect any mail from a company anyway.</li>" +
            "<li><div>Be Careful What Sensitive Information You Send In The Mail:</div>Most of our commitments with banking, policy payments, and anything similar can be handled online these days. Do you need to use the post? You should try to avoid putting anything personal in the post whenever possible.</li>" +
            "<li><div>Take Note If Anything Seems To Be Missing From Your Mailbox:</div>If you’re expecting a letter and it hasn’t shown up, double check with the sender to make sure it was actually forwarded. If it was, consider changing the details attached to the respective account.</li>" +
            "</ul>" +
            "<h2>How To Report Mail Fraud</h2>" +
            "<p>If you’re a victim of mail fraud, you should always report it to the fraud organizations in your country to aid them in shutting the scammer down. That being said, you’re unlikely to see your money back since the process is far too slow-moving. At PayBack, our expert team works fast to track down your money and get it back as swiftly as possible. Simply get in touch to arrange your free consultation.</p>" ,

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">12 Easy Ways To Check If A Website Is Legit Or A Scam</h1>" +
            "<p>The internet is a cruel mistress that can chew up and spit out even the initiated when we drop guard. Sometimes, websites aren’t what they seem to be – people spend a lot of time and resources imitating legit services in order to commit fraud or for other nefarious reasons. </p>" +
            "<p>Scams are plentiful online so it’s important for you to know how to check if a website is legit or not. If you’re reading this because you’ve been scammed or are cautious that it might happen to you, you’re certainly not alone there. </p>" +
            "<h2>The Dangers Of A Scam Website</h2>" +
            "<p>When you look at the numbers, you’ll find that the amount of scams out there online is actually quite disturbing. For example, anyone who uses dating websites should be able to identify a scam profile, or has at least seen some in their time online. That’s because 1 in 10 profiles is a scam. And this isn’t the only place you need to look – just check your spam folder in your email inbox. In 2019 alone, phishing attempts rose by 65%; imposter fraud is responsible for just shy of $500 million each year. The list really does go on. </p>" +
            "<p>There are steps you can take, as an everyday internet user, to know how to tell if a website is legit, as well as protect yourself and ensure you’re never made a victim of fraud or hacking. </p>" +
            "<h2>12 Ways To Check If A Website Is Legit</h2>" +
            "<h3>1. Check URLs Carefully:</h3>" +
            "<p>Sometimes, it can be all too easy to mistype or fail to notice the slightest difference from a legit URL. That’s precisely what scam sites are banking on here. Many sites are made to perfectly mimic the real Facebook, for example, in order to phish your details. Use a scam website checker if you’re ever unsure.</p>" +
            "<h3>2. SSL Certificates:</h3>" +
            "<p>An SSL certificate is what gives you the little padlock in the top left of your URL bar. It’s also what turns a website from HTTP to HTTPS. All eCommerce, online banking, social media sites – or any that wants to be trustworthy – will have an SSL certificate. HTTPS is much more secure and should appease anyone wondering ‘is this website legit?’. Sites like Payback can help should you fall foul to a broker that doesn’t have SSL encryption, for example.</p>" +
            "<h3>3. View Certificate Details:</h3>" +
            "<p>If you want to see for yourself if an SSL certificate is legit, you need only click the padlock in the URL bar and hit ‘View Certificate’. This will show you when the certificate was added to the website. And for added peace of mind, this can’t be faked – it’s displayed by your browser and added by the site’s hosting company.</p>" +
            "<h3>4. Check Contact Information:</h3>" +
            "<p>No scam website is going to give out their own contact information, but go careful: they’ll likely use the same details of the site they’re the impostor of. You can always use these details to verify the website for yourself, or simply run the URL checker for a proper website review.</p>" +
            "<h3>5. Read The About Us Page:</h3>" +
            "<p>Companies like to scream from the rooftops about their heritage, as well as the journey that led them to where they are now. Even if they haven’t been live long, you’ll still find it there. The absence of this information is a massive red flag – you’ll likely want to avoid that website. </p>" +
            "<h3>6. Look For A Privacy Policy and Read It:</h3>" +
            "<p>It’s common to not read privacy policies – we’re all guilty of it. But if you’re doubting the integrity of a website, you should check to see if it even has one. If it does, read it. You’ll soon find out whether a website is authentic or not when you see how the owners approach legalese. </p>" +
            "<h3>7. Read Online Reviews:</h3>" +
            "<p>Word of mouth is a powerful thing, and people like to share their experiences – often, it’s to vent, not to warn others. But a lot can be learned by what other people have to say about your suspected scammer, so check popular review websites.</p>" +
            "<h3>8. Can The Site Be Verified On Social Media?:</h3>" +
            "<p>Social presence is important for building an audience or readership, and can do wonders for online popularity. That isn’t to say every company or site owner has social profiles but plenty to do. Check popular social media sites and see how active their profiles are, as well as when they were established. </p>" +
            "<h3>9. Look For Trust Badges:</h3>" +
            "<p>Trust badges offer a surefire way for websites to prove their legitimacy. All major eCommerce websites will have them, displayed pride of place so as not to prevent any potential sales. They’re also used to promote USPs. Be sure that these can be verified, however. </p>" +
            "<h3>10. Check Domain Ages:</h3>" +
            "<p>The length of domain ownership can show you not only when it was purchased but also when since when it was made active. What’s more, you can see the platform that hosts it, and look to verify this also. Use a domain checker to learn all you need to. </p>" +
            "<h3>11. Spelling and Grammar:</h3>" +
            "<p>The longer a scammer spends on the finer details, the longer they have to wait to unleash their scam. Plus, the teams running these nefarious websites are often small, so the small details like spelling and grammar tend to be overlooked. You wouldn’t see a spelling mistake on your online banking platform, would you?</p>" +
            "<h3>12. If It Doesn’t Seem Right, Don’t Risk It:</h3>" +
            "<p>For all the reasons above, and any others you can think of – gut feeling, even- don’t bother with it. Anything you’re looking for can be found elsewhere anyway, whether it’s online shopping, social media, news, or anything else. </p>" +
            "<h3>What To Do If You Get Scammed</h3>" +

        text: "<h1 class=\"how-it-works__major-text\">Is Online Shopping Safe? Tips To Avoid Scam Online Stores</h1>" +
            "<p>Let’s be honest, who doesn’t do online shopping these days? Brick-and-mortar locations have definitely felt the blow over the years, which is why they all have an online presence. Those that don’t have either long since faded out or likely don’t have long left. Even grocery stores made the move in recent years. </p>" +
            "<p>But with every consumer trend comes a scheme to follow, and that’s why online shopping fraud is a massive problem. In 2018 alone, the FTC reported the loss of almost $1.5 billion to internet sales scams. Read on to learn more about how to tell if an online store is safe, online shopping scams, and what the right course of action is should they happen to you. </p>" +
            "<h2>What Is An Online Shopping Scam?</h2>" +
            "<p>The practice is exactly what the name suggests: anyone that purchases something from a fraudulent seller, doesn’t receive their goods, and has their money stolen has fallen victim to an online shopping scam. Knowing how to spot the types of scams, though, starts with understanding the most common types: </p>" +
            "<h3>Classified Scams</h3>" +
            "<p>The classified scam can often be rather dangerous. Using websites like Craiglist to purchase goods, meeting a person, and having your money stolen could see you get seriously injured. Let’s be honest, you put a lot of trust into strangers when you purchase something without the protection of regulation and legitimacy. Proving that you’ve been scammed in this way might even be difficult to prove. That’s why you should never hand any money over without getting the goods, just be cautious when meeting with people you don’t know. </p>" +
            "<h3>Illegitimate Retailers</h3>" +
            "<p>The technology available means it’s easy to set up scam online stores that easily replicate legitimate ones, tricking people into paying for goods they’ll never receive. The easiest way to notice identify these is that despite having the same logo, layout, graphics, and everything else, the methods of payment will be different. Expect to see wire transfers, pre-loaded gift cards, or some sort of money order as the required methods. This is what ensures you won’t be able to recall any of the money you’ve spent. </p>" +
            "<h3>Medical Products</h3>" +
            "<p>It’s not uncommon that people will turn to the internet in order to find their much-needed medication for a lesser price. This is exactly what lures people in. It’s a sorry state of affairs when the people most in need and desperate are being deprived of their money, especially when the money they’ve wasted on a scam is meant to ensure their quality of life. </p>",

            "<p>PayPal has positioned itself as probably the most popular online payment system since it started out back in 1998. Whether to provide a platform for those who have their own online businesses, send money between family members across countries, or to have a faster, more secure way of making transactions online: it’s easy to see why more than 360 million people use it. </p>" +
            "<p>But, as to be expected, it’s long been a way for scammers to try and part people with their hard-earned cash, whether it’s through phishing or the PayPal friends and family scam. Keep reading to learn about the different types of scams and what you can do to get your money back should you become the next victim.</p>" +
            "<h2>Can You Get Scammed On PayPal?</h2>" +
            "<p>The simple answer? Yes. It’s possible to get scammed almost anywhere online, and PayPal is no exception. There are various ways in which it can be done, and many of them rely on naivety and failure on your part for them to work. Even simple steps on your part can help to prevent this from happening, such as verifying the amount being requested, as well as a seller’s details. </p>" +
            "<p>In order to properly protect yourself from the types of PayPal fraud out there, you’ll first need to know what they are. Read on to learn more about them. </p>" +
            "<h2>6 Types Of Paypal Scams</h2>" +
            "<h3>1. Scam Email</h3>" +
            "<p>If you find an email in your inbox addressed from PayPal, though unlikely, there’s a chance it’s come from a fraudulent source. It’ll likely ask you to follow the link embedded in the PayPal scam email, either because it needs you to prove your login details or there’s a problem with your account, and then you’ll get phished; which leads to the next point.</p>" +
            "<h3>2. Phishing</h3>" +
            "<p>PayPal phishing is successful simply because you’ve handed over your sensitive information, like your login details, to gain access to your account and empty your balance. This is usually done via email, and you’d be surprised how simple it is to fall for. The PayPal scam email you’re sent will likely look identical to any the company would send you. </p>" +
            "<h3>3. Fake Shipping Address</h3>" +
            "<p>This scam starts with a person paying for an item with a fake delivery address. When the shipping company rejects delivery several times, they make contact and change it to a valid one, without informing PayPal. They then tell PayPal that the item was undelivered and get a refund, leaving the seller without their goods and no money to show for it. </p>" +
            "<h3>4. Over Pay Scam</h3>" +
            "<p>A scam buyer may send too much money for an item they order to then request the overpayment back. Once this is received, they’ll then tell PayPal that their account has been hacked or compromised and issue a refund for the full amount. That means you, the seller, have lost out on the amount that was originally overpaid. </p>" +
            "<h3>5. Friends and Family Scam</h3>" +
            "<p>PayPal Friends and Family, sadly, leaves people open to a lot of scamming potential for one main reason: the payments are non-refundable. Often, fake sellers will try to convince you to send your money via this method, ensuring that, should you comply, you won’t be able to reclaim your funds and there’s nothing that PayPal can or will do anything about it. </p>" +
            "<h3>6. Advance Payment Scam</h3>" +
            "<p>If anyone offers you free money, alarm bells should be ringing – especially if it’s a stranger online. You certainly wouldn’t be so trustworthy if it was a person on the street. If you’re promised vast amounts of money, likely on the basis that you’ve won a competition, the fraudster may ask that you first send a small fee, probably for “tax purposes”, before they send you your winnings. You won’t see a penny after that, nor will you hear from this person again. </p>" +
            "<h2>Does PayPal Refund Money If You’re Scammed? </h2>" +
            "<p>The first thing you should do following a scam is to place a PayPal fraud report. Though it doesn’t actually replace the funds itself, it does enable you to refund money for issues like items not being sent/received, or if you suspect fraud. As mentioned above, though, this is what leaves room for scammers to take hold of your funds, so it’s a double-edged sword. What’s more, if you use the family and friends feature, you rule out PayPal’s refund abilities altogether. Even in the event of scams, there are various examples online of frustrated users that are left out of pocket with no recourse.</p>" +
            "<p>Thankfully, you don’t need to fret too much, frantically calling PayPal’s customer services and sending multiple emails hoping for a quick response. You’ll be able to process a refund yourself in the dashboard, and this will no doubt move much quicker than even getting through to the support team on your first attempt at calling. </p>" +
            "<h2>How To Get Your Money Back From PayPal If You’re Scammed</h2>" +
            "<p>Be sure to follow the process and act quickly, as the longer your money is in the hands of scammers, the less likely you are to get it back. Plus, PayPal’s powers don’t extend beyond its software, so should the money be withdrawn and sent to a bank account, there’s essentially nothing the platform can do at that point. </p>" +

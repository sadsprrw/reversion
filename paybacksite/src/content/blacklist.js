//     "The number of trading scams in the binary options space is substantial. Because some of the largest regulatory agencies around the world have banned binary options, many former (and new) brokers have had to reestablish their businesses in nations where there is little to no real regulation. The broad bans of binary options have resulted in thousands of unregistered brokers all around the globe. Brokers within the binary options space have questionable to outright fraudulent data feeds. It’s not uncommon to see bids and ask fluctuate violently within the final micro-seconds resulting in significant losses, sometimes on both sides of the trade! You can avoid some of the trading scams by using only regulated brokers, although very few are legitimate."

//     "Signal scams are hands down the most prevalent form of financial fraud and scams in today’s markets. For the binary options market, signal scams involve an individual or company that offers to sell you trade ideas (signals) in exchange for a monthly fee. The signals are provided via text, email, or via their website. The most popular version of providing signals in most markets is through the chat platform Telegram. As with any financial instrument, it is best to avoid signal providers – they are only interested in making money from you as a subscriber."

Legitimate brokers will openly disclose their license number and cite the national regulatory agency and website. </li> <li> Do your due diligence – read user reviews across various sources. Be wary of sites that are specific to reviewing only binary options brokers – they are more than likely just shell sites meant to push you to a particular broker or a few select brokers. </li> <li> If the broker is unregulated, check where the broker is based – it’s good to know what nation the business is headquartered in. </li> <li> If you do want to risk your capital in the binary options markets, test the broker’s  data yourself. Vet the broker and ensure that data feeds are authentic and that there are no abnormal price changes near expiry. </li> </ul>"
